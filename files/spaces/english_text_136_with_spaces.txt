alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank and of having nothing to do once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading
but it had no pictures or conversations in it and what is the use of a book thought alice without pictures or conversations so she was considering in her own mind as
well as she could for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid whether the pleasure of making a daisy chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and
picking the daisies when suddenly a white rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her there was nothing so very remarkable in that nor did alice think it so very much out
of the way to hear the rabbit say to itself oh dear oh dear i shall be late when she thought it over afterwards it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this
but at the time it all seemed quite natural but when the rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat pocket and looked at it and then hurried on alice started to
her feet for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat pocket or a watch to take out of it and burning with curiosity
she ran across the field after it and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit hole under the hedge in another moment down went alice after it
never once considering how in the world she was to get out again the rabbit hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way and then dipped suddenly down so suddenly
that alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well either the well was very deep or she fell very
slowly for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next first she tried to look down and make out what she was
coming to but it was too dark to see anything then she looked at the sides of the well and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book shelves here and there
she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs she took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed it was labelled orange marmalade but to her great disappointment it
was empty she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it well thought alice to herself
after such a fall as this i shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs how brave theyll all think me at home why i wouldnt say anything about it even if i fell off the
top of the house which was very likely true down down down would the fall never come to an end i wonder how many miles ive fallen by this time she said aloud i must be
getting somewhere near the centre of the earth let me see that would be four thousand miles down i think for you see alice had learnt several things of this sort in
her lessons in the schoolroom and though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge as there was no one to listen to her still it was good
practice to say it over yes thats about the right distance but then i wonder what latitude or longitude ive got to alice had no idea what latitude was or longitude
either but thought they were nice grand words to say presently she began again i wonder if i shall fall right through the earth how funny itll seem to come out among
the people that walk with their heads downward the antipathies i think she was rather glad there was no one listening this time as it didnt sound at all the right
word but i shall have to ask them what the name of the country is you know please maam is this new zealand or australia and she tried to curtsey as she spoke fancy
curtseying as youre falling through the air do you think you could manage it and what an ignorant little girl shell think me for asking no itll never do to ask
perhaps i shall see it written up somewhere down down down there was nothing else to do so alice soon began talking again dinahll miss me very much to night i should
think dinah was the cat i hope theyll remember her saucer of milk at tea time dinah my dear i wish you were down here with me there are no mice in the air im afraid but you
might catch a bat and thats very like a mouse you know but do cats eat bats i wonder and here alice began to get rather sleepy and went on saying to herself in a dreamy
sort of way do cats eat bats do cats eat bats and sometimes do bats eat cats for you see as she couldnt answer either question it didnt much matter which way she put it
she felt that she was dozing off and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with dinah and saying to her very earnestly now dinah tell me the truth
did you ever eat a bat when suddenly thump thump down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves and the fall was over alice was not a bit hurt and she jumped up on to
her feet in a moment she looked up but it was all dark overhead before her was another long passage and the white rabbit was still in sight hurrying down it there was
not a moment to be lost away went alice like the wind and was just in time to hear it say as it turned a corner oh my ears and whiskers how late its getting she was close
behind it when she turned the corner but the rabbit was no longer to be seen she found herself in a long low hall which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof
there were doors all round the hall but they were all locked and when alice had been all the way down one side and up the other trying every door she walked sadly down
the middle wondering how she was ever to get out again suddenly she came upon a little three legged table all made of solid glass there was nothing on it except a tiny
golden key and alices first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall but alas either the locks were too large or the key was too small but at any
rate it would not open any of them however on the second time round she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before and behind it was a little door about fifteen
inches high she tried the little golden key in the lock and to her great delight it fitted alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage not much
larger than a rat hole she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw how she longed to get out of that dark hall and wander about
among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains but she could not even get her head through the doorway and even if my head would go through thought poor
alice it would be of very little use without my shoulders oh how i wish i could shut up like a telescope i think i could if i only knew how to begin for you see so many out
of the way things had happened lately that alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible there seemed to be no use in waiting by the
little door so she went back to the table half hoping she might find another key on it or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes this time
she found a little bottle on it which certainly was not here before said alice and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label with the words drink me beautifully
printed on it in large letters it was all very well to say drink me but the wise little alice was not going to do that in a hurry no ill look first she said and see whether
its marked poison or not for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things all
because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them such as that a red hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long and that if you cut
your finger very deeply with a knife it usually bleeds and she had never forgotten that if you drink much from a bottle marked poison it is almost certain to
disagree with you sooner or later however this bottle was not marked poison so alice ventured to taste it and finding it very nice it had in fact a sort of mixed
flavour of cherry tart custard pine apple roast turkey toffee and hot buttered toast she very soon finished it off what a curious feeling said alice i must be
shutting up like a telescope and so it was indeed she was now only ten inches high and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going
through the little door into that lovely garden first however she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further she felt a little nervous
about this for it might end you know said alice to herself in my going out altogether like a candle i wonder what i should be like then and she tried to fancy what the
flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing after a while finding that nothing more happened she
decided on going into the garden at once but alas for poor alice when she got to the door she found she had forgotten the little golden key and when she went back to the
table for it she found she could not possibly reach it she could see it quite plainly through the glass and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table
but it was too slippery and when she had tired herself out with trying the poor little thing sat down and cried come theres no use in crying like that said alice to
herself rather sharply i advise you to leave off this minute she generally gave herself very good advice though she very seldom followed it and sometimes she
scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was
playing against herself for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people but its no use now thought poor alice to pretend to be two people why
theres hardly enough of me left to make one respectable person soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table she opened it and found in it a
very small cake on which the words eat me were beautifully marked in currants well ill eat it said alice and if it makes me grow larger i can reach the key and if it
makes me grow smaller i can creep under the door so either way ill get into the garden and i dont care which happens she ate a little bit and said anxiously to herself
which way which way holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size to be
sure this generally happens when one eats cake but alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out of the way things to happen that it seemed quite
dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way so she set to work and very soon finished off the cake curiouser and curiouser cried alice she was so much surprised
that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good english now im opening out like the largest telescope that ever was good bye feet for when she looked down at
her feet they seemed to be almost out of sight they were getting so far off oh my poor little feet i wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now dears im
sure i shant be able i shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you you must manage the best way you can but i must be kind to them thought alice or
perhaps they wont walk the way i want to go let me see ill give them a new pair of boots every christmas and she went on planning to herself how she would manage it they
must go by the carrier she thought and how funny itll seem sending presents to ones own feet and how odd the directions will look alices right foot esq hearthrug
near the fender with alices love oh dear what nonsense im talking just then her head struck against the roof of the hall in fact she was now more than nine feet high
and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door poor alice it was as much as she could do lying down on one side to look through into the
garden with one eye but to get through was more hopeless than ever she sat down and began to cry again you ought to be ashamed of yourself said alice a great girl like
you she might well say this to go on crying in this way stop this moment i tell you but she went on all the same shedding gallons of tears until there was a large pool all
round her about four inches deep and reaching half down the hall after a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance and she hastily dried her eyes to
see what was coming it was the white rabbit returning splendidly dressed with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other he came trotting
along in a great hurry muttering to himself as he came oh the duchess the duchess oh wont she be savage if ive kept her waiting alice felt so desperate that she was
ready to ask help of any one so when the rabbit came near her she began in a low timid voice if you please sir the rabbit started violently dropped the white kid gloves
and the fan and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go alice took up the fan and gloves and as the hall was very hot she kept fanning herself all the time
she went on talking dear dear how queer everything is to day and yesterday things went on just as usual i wonder if ive been changed in the night let me think was i the
same when i got up this morning i almost think i can remember feeling a little different but if im not the same the next question is who in the world am i ah thats the
great puzzle and she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself to see if she could have been changed for any of them im sure im
not ada she said for her hair goes in such long ringlets and mine doesnt go in ringlets at all and im sure i cant be mabel for i know all sorts of things and she oh she
knows such a very little besides shes she and im i and oh dear how puzzling it all is ill try if i know all the things i used to know let me see four times five is twelve and
four times six is thirteen and four times seven is oh dear i shall never get to twenty at that rate however the multiplication table doesnt signify lets try
geography london is the capital of paris and paris is the capital of rome and rome no thats all wrong im certain i must have been changed for mabel ill try and say how
doth the little and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons and began to repeat it but her voice sounded hoarse and strange and the words did not
come the same as they used to do how doth the little crocodile improve his shining tail and pour the waters of the nile on every golden scale how cheerfully he seems
to grin how neatly spread his claws and welcome little fishes in with gently smiling jaws im sure those are not the right words said poor alice and her eyes filled
with tears again as she went on i must be mabel after all and i shall have to go and live in that poky little house and have next to no toys to play with and oh ever so many
lessons to learn no ive made up my mind about it if im mabel ill stay down here itll be no use their putting their heads down and saying come up again dear i shall only
look up and say who am i then tell me that first and then if i like being that person ill come up if not ill stay down here till im somebody else but oh dear cried alice
with a sudden burst of tears i do wish they would put their heads down i am so very tired of being all alone here as she said this she looked down at her hands and was
surprised to see that she had put on one of the rabbits little white kid gloves while she was talking how can i have done that she thought i must be growing small again
she got up and went to the table to measure herself by it and found that as nearly as she could guess she was now about two feet high and was going on shrinking rapidly
she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding and she dropped it hastily just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether that was a narrow
escape said alice a good deal frightened at the sudden change but very glad to find herself still in existence and now for the garden and she ran with all speed back
to the little door but alas the little door was shut again and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before and things are worse than ever thought the
poor child for i never was so small as this before never and i declare its too bad that it is as she said these words her foot slipped and in another moment splash she
was up to her chin in salt water her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea and in that case i can go back by railway she said to herself alice had been to
the seaside once in her life and had come to the general conclusion that wherever you go to on the english coast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea some
children digging in the sand with wooden spades then a row of lodging houses and behind them a railway station however she soon made out that she was in the pool of
tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high i wish i hadnt cried so much said alice as she swam about trying to find her way out i shall be punished for it now i
suppose by being drowned in my own tears that will be a queer thing to be sure however everything is queer to day just then she heard something splashing about in the
pool a little way off and she swam nearer to make out what it was at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus but then she remembered how small she was now
and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself would it be of any use now thought alice to speak to this mouse everything is so out of the
way down here that i should think very likely it can talk at any rate theres no harm in trying so she began o mouse do you know the way out of this pool i am very tired of
swimming about here o mouse alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse she had never done such a thing before but she remembered having seen in
her brothers latin grammar a mouse of a mouse to a mouse a mouse o mouse the mouse looked at her rather inquisitively and seemed to her to wink with one of its little
eyes but it said nothing perhaps it doesnt understand english thought alice i daresay its a french mouse come over with william the conqueror for with all her
knowledge of history alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened so she began again ou est ma chatte which was the first sentence in her french
lesson book the mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water and seemed to quiver all over with fright oh i beg your pardon cried alice hastily afraid that she had hurt
the poor animals feelings i quite forgot you didnt like cats not like cats cried the mouse in a shrill passionate voice would you like cats if you were me well
perhaps not said alice in a soothing tone dont be angry about it and yet i wish i could show you our cat dinah i think youd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her
she is such a dear quiet thing alice went on half to herself as she swam lazily about in the pool and she sits purring so nicely by the fire licking her paws and washing
her face and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse and shes such a capital one for catching mice oh i beg your pardon cried alice again for this time the mouse was
bristling all over and she felt certain it must be really offended we wont talk about her any more if youd rather not we indeed cried the mouse who was trembling down
to the end of his tail as if i would talk on such a subject our family always hated cats nasty low vulgar things dont let me hear the name again i wont indeed said alice
in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation are you are you fond of of dogs the mouse did not answer so alice went on eagerly there is such a nice little dog
near our house i should like to show you a little bright eyed terrier you know with oh such long curly brown hair and itll fetch things when you throw them and itll sit
up and beg for its dinner and all sorts of things i cant remember half of them and it belongs to a farmer you know and he says its so useful its worth a hundred pounds he
says it kills all the rats and oh dear cried alice in a sorrowful tone im afraid ive offended it again for the mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go and
making quite a commotion in the pool as it went so she called softly after it mouse dear do come back again and we wont talk about cats or dogs either if you dont like
them when the mouse heard this it turned round and swam slowly back to her its face was quite pale with passion alice thought and it said in a low trembling voice let
us get to the shore and then ill tell you my history and youll understand why it is i hate cats and dogs it was high time to go for the pool was getting quite crowded with
the birds and animals that had fallen into it there were a duck and a dodo a lory and an eaglet and several other curious creatures alice led the way and the whole
party swam to the shore they were indeed a queer looking party that assembled on the bank the birds with draggled feathers the animals with their fur clinging
close to them and all dripping wet cross and uncomfortable the first question of course was how to get dry again they had a consultation about this and after a few
minutes it seemed quite natural to alice to find herself talking familiarly with them as if she had known them all her life indeed she had quite a long argument with
the lory who at last turned sulky and would only say i am older than you and must know better and this alice would not allow without knowing how old it was and as the
lory positively refused to tell its age there was no more to be said at last the mouse who seemed to be a person of authority among them called out sit down all of you
and listen to me ill soon make you dry enough they all sat down at once in a large ring with the mouse in the middle alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it for she felt
sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon ahem said the mouse with an important air are you all ready this is the driest thing i know silence all
round if you please william the conqueror whose cause was favoured by the pope was soon submitted to by the english who wanted leaders and had been of late much
accustomed to usurpation and conquest edwin and morcar the earls of mercia and northumbria ugh said the lory with a shiver i beg your pardon said the mouse
frowning but very politely did you speak not i said the lory hastily i thought you did said the mouse i proceed edwin and morcar the earls of mercia and northumbria
declared for him and even stigand the patriotic archbishop of canterbury found it advisable found what said the duck found it the mouse replied rather crossly of
course you know what it means i know what it means well enough when i find a thing said the duck its generally a frog or a worm the question is what did the archbishop
find the mouse did not notice this question but hurriedly went on found it advisable to go with edgar atheling to meet william and offer him the crown williams
conduct at first was moderate but the insolence of his normans how are you getting on now my dear it continued turning to alice as it spoke as wet as ever said alice in
a melancholy tone it doesnt seem to dry me at all in that case said the dodo solemnly rising to its feet i move that the meeting adjourn for the immediate adoption of
more energetic remedies speak english said the eaglet i dont know the meaning of half those long words and whats more i dont believe you do either and the eaglet
bent down its head to hide a smile some of the other birds tittered audibly what i was going to say said the dodo in an offended tone was that the best thing to get us dry
would be a caucus race what is a caucus race said alice not that she wanted much to know but the dodo had paused as if it thought that somebody ought to speak and no one
else seemed inclined to say anything why said the dodo the best way to explain it is to do it and as you might like to try the thing yourself some winter day i will tell
you how the dodo managed it first it marked out a race course in a sort of circle the exact shape doesnt matter it said and then all the party were placed along the
course here and there there was no one two three and away but they began running when they liked and left off when they liked so that it was not easy to know when the
race was over however when they had been running half an hour or so and were quite dry again the dodo suddenly called out the race is over and they all crowded round it
panting and asking but who has won this question the dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its
forehead the position in which you usually see shakespeare in the pictures of him while the rest waited in silence at last the dodo said everybody has won and all
must have prizes but who is to give the prizes quite a chorus of voices asked why she of course said the dodo pointing to alice with one finger and the whole party at
once crowded round her calling out in a confused way prizes prizes alice had no idea what to do and in despair she put her hand in her pocket and pulled out a box of
comfits luckily the salt water had not got into it and handed them round as prizes there was exactly one a piece all round but she must have a prize herself you know
said the mouse of course the dodo replied very gravely what else have you got in your pocket he went on turning to alice only a thimble said alice sadly hand it over
here said the dodo then they all crowded round her once more while the dodo solemnly presented the thimble saying we beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble
and when it had finished this short speech they all cheered alice thought the whole thing very absurd but they all looked so grave that she did not dare to laugh and
as she could not think of anything to say she simply bowed and took the thimble looking as solemn as she could the next thing was to eat the comfits this caused some
noise and confusion as the large birds complained that they could not taste theirs and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back however it was over at
last and they sat down again in a ring and begged the mouse to tell them something more you promised to tell me your history you know said alice and why it is you hate c
and d she added in a whisper half afraid that it would be offended again mine is a long and a sad tale said the mouse turning to alice and sighing it is a long tail
certainly said alice looking down with wonder at the mouses tail but why do you call it sad and she kept on puzzling about it while the mouse was speaking so that her
idea of the tale was something like this fury said to a mouse that he met in the house let us both go to law i will prosecute you come ill take no denial we must have a
trial for really this morning ive nothing to do said the mouse to the cur such a trial dear sir with no jury or judge would be wasting our breath ill be judge ill be jury
said cunning old fury ill try the whole cause and condemn you to death you are not attending said the mouse to alice severely what are you thinking of i beg your
pardon said alice very humbly you had got to the fifth bend i think i had not cried the mouse sharply and very angrily a knot said alice always ready to make herself
useful and looking anxiously about her oh do let me help to undo it i shall do nothing of the sort said the mouse getting up and walking away you insult me by talking
such nonsense i didnt mean it pleaded poor alice but youre so easily offended you know the mouse only growled in reply please come back and finish your story alice
called after it and the others all joined in chorus yes please do but the mouse only shook its head impatiently and walked a little quicker what a pity it wouldnt
stay sighed the lory as soon as it was quite out of sight and an old crab took the opportunity of saying to her daughter ah my dear let this be a lesson to you never to
lose your temper hold your tongue ma said the young crab a little snappishly youre enough to try the patience of an oyster i wish i had our dinah here i know i do said
alice aloud addressing nobody in particular shed soon fetch it back and who is dinah if i might venture to ask the question said the lory alice replied eagerly for
she was always ready to talk about her pet dinahs our cat and shes such a capital one for catching mice you cant think and oh i wish you could see her after the birds why
shell eat a little bird as soon as look at it this speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party some of the birds hurried off at once one old magpie began
wrapping itself up very carefully remarking i really must be getting home the night air doesnt suit my throat and a canary called out in a trembling voice to its
children come away my dears its high time you were all in bed on various pretexts they all moved off and alice was soon left alone i wish i hadnt mentioned dinah she
said to herself in a melancholy tone nobody seems to like her down here and im sure shes the best cat in the world oh my dear dinah i wonder if i shall ever see you any
more and here poor alice began to cry again for she felt very lonely and low spirited in a little while however she again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the
distance and she looked up eagerly half hoping that the mouse had changed his mind and was coming back to finish his story it was the white rabbit trotting slowly
back again and looking anxiously about as it went as if it had lost something and she heard it muttering to itself the duchess the duchess oh my dear paws oh my fur and
whiskers shell get me executed as sure as ferrets are ferrets where can i have dropped them i wonder alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the
pair of white kid gloves and she very good naturedly began hunting about for them but they were nowhere to be seen everything seemed to have changed since her swim
in the pool and the great hall with the glass table and the little door had vanished completely very soon the rabbit noticed alice as she went hunting about and
called out to her in an angry tone why mary ann what are you doing out here run home this moment and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan quick now and alice was so much
frightened that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to without trying to explain the mistake it had made he took me for his housemaid she said to herself
as she ran how surprised hell be when he finds out who i am but id better take him his fan and gloves that is if i can find them as she said this she came upon a neat little
house on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name w rabbit engraved upon it she went in without knocking and hurried upstairs in great fear lest she
should meet the real mary ann and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves how queer it seems alice said to herself to be going messages for a
rabbit i suppose dinahll be sending me on messages next and she began fancying the sort of thing that would happen miss alice come here directly and get ready for
your walk coming in a minute nurse but ive got to see that the mouse doesnt get out only i dont think alice went on that theyd let dinah stop in the house if it began
ordering people about like that by this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window and on it as she had hoped a fan and two or three
pairs of tiny white kid gloves she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves and was just going to leave the room when her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the
looking glass there was no label this time with the words drink me but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips i know something interesting is sure to
happen she said to herself whenever i eat or drink anything so ill just see what this bottle does i do hope itll make me grow large again for really im quite tired of
being such a tiny little thing it did so indeed and much sooner than she had expected before she had drunk half the bottle she found her head pressing against the
ceiling and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken she hastily put down the bottle saying to herself thats quite enough i hope i shant grow any more as it is i
cant get out at the door i do wish i hadnt drunk quite so much alas it was too late to wish that she went on growing and growing and very soon had to kneel down on the floor
in another minute there was not even room for this and she tried the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door and the other arm curled round her head still
she went on growing and as a last resource she put one arm out of the window and one foot up the chimney and said to herself now i can do no more whatever happens what
will become of me luckily for alice the little magic bottle had now had its full effect and she grew no larger still it was very uncomfortable and as there seemed to
be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room again no wonder she felt unhappy it was much pleasanter at home thought poor alice when one wasnt always
growing larger and smaller and being ordered about by mice and rabbits i almost wish i hadnt gone down that rabbit hole and yet and yet its rather curious you know
this sort of life i do wonder what can have happened to me when i used to read fairy tales i fancied that kind of thing never happened and now here i am in the middle of
one there ought to be a book written about me that there ought and when i grow up ill write one but im grown up now she added in a sorrowful tone at least theres no room to
grow up any more here but then thought alice shall i never get any older than i am now thatll be a comfort one way never to be an old woman but then always to have lessons
to learn oh i shouldnt like that oh you foolish alice she answered herself how can you learn lessons in here why theres hardly room for you and no room at all for any
lesson books and so she went on taking first one side and then the other and making quite a conversation of it altogether but after a few minutes she heard a voice
outside and stopped to listen mary ann mary ann said the voice fetch me my gloves this moment then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs alice knew it was the
rabbit coming to look for her and she trembled till she shook the house quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large as the rabbit and had no
reason to be afraid of it presently the rabbit came up to the door and tried to open it but as the door opened inwards and alices elbow was pressed hard against it that
attempt proved a failure alice heard it say to itself then ill go round and get in at the window that you wont thought alice and after waiting till she fancied she
heard the rabbit just under the window she suddenly spread out her hand and made a snatch in the air she did not get hold of anything but she heard a little shriek and a
fall and a crash of broken glass from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumber frame or something of the sort next came an angry
voice the rabbits pat pat where are you and then a voice she had never heard before sure then im here digging for apples yer honour digging for apples indeed said the
rabbit angrily here come and help me out of this sounds of more broken glass now tell me pat whats that in the window sure its an arm yer honour he pronounced it arrum
an arm you goose who ever saw one that size why it fills the whole window sure it does yer honour but its an arm for all that well its got no business there at any rate go
and take it away there was a long silence after this and alice could only hear whispers now and then such as sure i dont like it yer honour at all at all do as i tell you
you coward and at last she spread out her hand again and made another snatch in the air this time there were two little shrieks and more sounds of broken glass what a
number of cucumber frames there must be thought alice i wonder what theyll do next as for pulling me out of the window i only wish they could im sure i dont want to stay
in here any longer she waited for some time without hearing anything more at last came a rumbling of little cartwheels and the sound of a good many voices all
talking together she made out the words wheres the other ladder why i hadnt to bring but one bills got the other bill fetch it here lad here put em up at this corner no
tie em together first they dont reach half high enough yet oh theyll do well enough dont be particular here bill catch hold of this rope will the roof bear mind that
loose slate oh its coming down heads below a loud crash now who did that it was bill i fancy whos to go down the chimney nay i shant you do it that i wont then bills to go
down here bill the master says youre to go down the chimney oh so bills got to come down the chimney has he said alice to herself shy they seem to put everything upon
bill i wouldnt be in bills place for a good deal this fireplace is narrow to be sure but i think i can kick a little she drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could
and waited till she heard a little animal she couldnt guess of what sort it was scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her then saying to
herself this is bill she gave one sharp kick and waited to see what would happen next the first thing she heard was a general chorus of there goes bill then the
rabbits voice along catch him you by the hedge then silence and then another confusion of voices hold up his head brandy now dont choke him how was it old fellow what
happened to you tell us all about it last came a little feeble squeaking voice thats bill thought alice well i hardly know no more thank ye im better now but im a deal
too flustered to tell you all i know is something comes at me like a jack in the box and up i goes like a sky rocket so you did old fellow said the others we must burn the
house down said the rabbits voice and alice called out as loud as she could if you do ill set dinah at you there was a dead silence instantly and alice thought to
herself i wonder what they will do next if they had any sense theyd take the roof off after a minute or two they began moving about again and alice heard the rabbit say
a barrowful will do to begin with a barrowful of what thought alice but she had not long to doubt for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the
window and some of them hit her in the face ill put a stop to this she said to herself and shouted out youd better not do that again which produced another dead silence
alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor and a bright idea came into her head if i eat one of these
cakes she thought its sure to make some change in my size and as it cant possibly make me larger it must make me smaller i suppose so she swallowed one of the cakes and
was delighted to find that she began shrinking directly as soon as she was small enough to get through the door she ran out of the house and found quite a crowd of
little animals and birds waiting outside the poor little lizard bill was in the middle being held up by two guinea pigs who were giving it something out of a bottle
they all made a rush at alice the moment she appeared but she ran off as hard as she could and soon found herself safe in a thick wood the first thing ive got to do said
alice to herself as she wandered about in the wood is to grow to my right size again and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden i think that will be
the best plan it sounded an excellent plan no doubt and very neatly and simply arranged the only difficulty was that she had not the smallest idea how to set about it
and while she was peering about anxiously among the trees a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a great hurry an enormous puppy was looking down
at her with large round eyes and feebly stretching out one paw trying to touch her poor little thing said alice in a coaxing tone and she tried hard to whistle to it
but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing
hardly knowing what she did she picked up a little bit of stick and held it out to the puppy whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at once with a yelp
of delight and rushed at the stick and made believe to worry it then alice dodged behind a great thistle to keep herself from being run over and the moment she
appeared on the other side the puppy made another rush at the stick and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it then alice thinking it was very like
having a game of play with a cart horse and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet ran round the thistle again then the puppy began a series of short
charges at the stick running a very little way forwards each time and a long way back and barking hoarsely all the while till at last it sat down a good way off panting
with its tongue hanging out of its mouth and its great eyes half shut this seemed to alice a good opportunity for making her escape so she set off at once and ran till
she was quite tired and out of breath and till the puppys bark sounded quite faint in the distance and yet what a dear little puppy it was said alice as she leant
against a buttercup to rest herself and fanned herself with one of the leaves i should have liked teaching it tricks very much if if id only been the right size to do
it oh dear id nearly forgotten that ive got to grow up again let me see how is it to be managed i suppose i ought to eat or drink something or other but the great question
is what the great question certainly was what alice looked all round her at the flowers and the blades of grass but she did not see anything that looked like the
right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances there was a large mushroom growing near her about the same height as herself and when she had looked under it and
on both sides of it and behind it it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it she stretched herself up on tiptoe and peeped over the
edge of the mushroom and her eyes immediately met those of a large caterpillar that was sitting on the top with its arms folded quietly smoking a long hookah and
taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else the caterpillar and alice looked at each other for some time in silence at last the caterpillar took the
hookah out of its mouth and addressed her in a languid sleepy voice who are you said the caterpillar this was not an encouraging opening for a conversation alice
replied rather shyly i i hardly know sir just at present at least i know who i was when i got up this morning but i think i must have been changed several times since
then what do you mean by that said the caterpillar sternly explain yourself i cant explain myself im afraid sir said alice because im not myself you see i dont see
said the caterpillar im afraid i cant put it more clearly alice replied very politely for i cant understand it myself to begin with and being so many different
sizes in a day is very confusing it isnt said the caterpillar well perhaps you havent found it so yet said alice but when you have to turn into a chrysalis you will
some day you know and then after that into a butterfly i should think youll feel it a little queer wont you not a bit said the caterpillar well perhaps your feelings
may be different said alice all i know is it would feel very queer to me you said the caterpillar contemptuously who are you which brought them back again to the
beginning of the conversation alice felt a little irritated at the caterpillars making such very short remarks and she drew herself up and said very gravely i
think you ought to tell me who you are first why said the caterpillar here was another puzzling question and as alice could not think of any good reason and as the
caterpillar seemed to be in a very unpleasant state of mind she turned away come back the caterpillar called after her ive something important to say this sounded
promising certainly alice turned and came back again keep your temper said the caterpillar is that all said alice swallowing down her anger as well as she could no
said the caterpillar alice thought she might as well wait as she had nothing else to do and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing for some
minutes it puffed away without speaking but at last it unfolded its arms took the hookah out of its mouth again and said so you think youre changed do you im afraid i
am sir said alice i cant remember things as i used and i dont keep the same size for ten minutes together cant remember what things said the caterpillar well ive
tried to say how doth the little busy bee but it all came different alice replied in a very melancholy voice repeat you are old father william said the caterpillar
alice folded her hands and began you are old father william the young man said and your hair has become very white and yet you incessantly stand on your head do you
think at your age it is right in my youth father william replied to his son i feared it might injure the brain but now that im perfectly sure i have none why i do it again
and again you are old said the youth as i mentioned before and have grown most uncommonly fat yet you turned a back somersault in at the door pray what is the reason of
that in my youth said the sage as he shook his grey locks i kept all my limbs very supple by the use of this ointment one shilling the box allow me to sell you a couple you
are old said the youth and your jaws are too weak for anything tougher than suet yet you finished the goose with the bones and the beak pray how did you manage to do it
in my youth said his father i took to the law and argued each case with my wife and the muscular strength which it gave to my jaw has lasted the rest of my life you are old
said the youth one would hardly suppose that your eye was as steady as ever yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose what made you so awfully clever i have
answered three questions and that is enough said his father dont give yourself airs do you think i can listen all day to such stuff be off or ill kick you down stairs
that is not said right said the caterpillar not quite right im afraid said alice timidly some of the words have got altered it is wrong from beginning to end said the
caterpillar decidedly and there was silence for some minutes the caterpillar was the first to speak what size do you want to be it asked oh im not particular as to
size alice hastily replied only one doesnt like changing so often you know i dont know said the caterpillar alice said nothing she had never been so much
contradicted in her life before and she felt that she was losing her temper are you content now said the caterpillar well i should like to be a little larger sir if
you wouldnt mind said alice three inches is such a wretched height to be it is a very good height indeed said the caterpillar angrily rearing itself upright as it
spoke it was exactly three inches high but im not used to it pleaded poor alice in a piteous tone and she thought of herself i wish the creatures wouldnt be so easily
offended youll get used to it in time said the caterpillar and it put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again this time alice waited patiently until it
chose to speak again in a minute or two the caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and yawned once or twice and shook itself then it got down off the mushroom and
crawled away in the grass merely remarking as it went one side will make you grow taller and the other side will make you grow shorter one side of what the other side
of what thought alice to herself of the mushroom said the caterpillar just as if she had asked it aloud and in another moment it was out of sight alice remained
looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute trying to make out which were the two sides of it and as it was perfectly round she found this a very difficult
question however at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand and now which is which she said to herself
and nibbled a little of the right hand bit to try the effect the next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin it had struck her foot she was a good deal
frightened by this very sudden change but she felt that there was no time to be lost as she was shrinking rapidly so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit
her chin was pressed so closely against her foot that there was hardly room to open her mouth but she did it at last and managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit
come my heads free at last said alice in a tone of delight which changed into alarm in another moment when she found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found all
she could see when she looked down was an immense length of neck which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her what can all that
green stuff be said alice and where have my shoulders got to and oh my poor hands how is it i cant see you she was moving them about as she spoke but no result seemed to
follow except a little shaking among the distant green leaves as there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head she tried to get her head down to them
and was delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction like a serpent she had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag and
was going to dive in among the leaves which she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a
hurry a large pigeon had flown into her face and was beating her violently with its wings serpent screamed the pigeon im not a serpent said alice indignantly let me
alone serpent i say again repeated the pigeon but in a more subdued tone and added with a kind of sob ive tried every way and nothing seems to suit them i havent the
least idea what youre talking about said alice ive tried the roots of trees and ive tried banks and ive tried hedges the pigeon went on without attending to her but
those serpents theres no pleasing them alice was more and more puzzled but she thought there was no use in saying anything more till the pigeon had finished as if it
wasnt trouble enough hatching the eggs said the pigeon but i must be on the look out for serpents night and day why i havent had a wink of sleep these three weeks im
very sorry youve been annoyed said alice who was beginning to see its meaning and just as id taken the highest tree in the wood continued the pigeon raising its
voice to a shriek and just as i was thinking i should be free of them at last they must needs come wriggling down from the sky ugh serpent but im not a serpent i tell you
said alice im a im a well what are you said the pigeon i can see youre trying to invent something i im a little girl said alice rather doubtfully as she remembered the
number of changes she had gone through that day a likely story indeed said the pigeon in a tone of the deepest contempt ive seen a good many little girls in my time but
never one with such a neck as that no no youre a serpent and theres no use denying it i suppose youll be telling me next that you never tasted an egg i have tasted eggs
certainly said alice who was a very truthful child but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do you know i dont believe it said the pigeon but if they do why
then theyre a kind of serpent thats all i can say this was such a new idea to alice that she was quite silent for a minute or two which gave the pigeon the opportunity of
adding youre looking for eggs i know that well enough and what does it matter to me whether youre a little girl or a serpent it matters a good deal to me said alice
hastily but im not looking for eggs as it happens and if i was i shouldnt want yours i dont like them raw well be off then said the pigeon in a sulky tone as it settled
down again into its nest alice crouched down among the trees as well as she could for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches and every now and then she
had to stop and untwist it after a while she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands and she set to work very carefully nibbling first at
one and then at the other and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height it was so long
since she had been anything near the right size that it felt quite strange at first but she got used to it in a few minutes and began talking to herself as usual come
theres half my plan done now how puzzling all these changes are im never sure what im going to be from one minute to another however ive got back to my right size the
next thing is to get into that beautiful garden how is that to be done i wonder as she said this she came suddenly upon an open place with a little house in it about four
feet high whoever lives there thought alice itll never do to come upon them this size why i should frighten them out of their wits so she began nibbling at the
righthand bit again and did not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high for a minute or two she stood looking at the house
and wondering what to do next when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the wood she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery otherwise
judging by his face only she would have called him a fish and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles it was opened by another footman in livery with a round face
and large eyes like a frog and both footmen alice noticed had powdered hair that curled all over their heads she felt very curious to know what it was all about and
crept a little way out of the wood to listen the fish footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter nearly as large as himself and this he handed over to
the other saying in a solemn tone for the duchess an invitation from the queen to play croquet the frog footman repeated in the same solemn tone only changing the
order of the words a little from the queen an invitation for the duchess to play croquet then they both bowed low and their curls got entangled together alice
laughed so much at this that she had to run back into the wood for fear of their hearing her and when she next peeped out the fish footman was gone and the other was
sitting on the ground near the door staring stupidly up into the sky alice went timidly up to the door and knocked theres no sort of use in knocking said the footman
and that for two reasons first because im on the same side of the door as you are secondly because theyre making such a noise inside no one could possibly hear you and
certainly there was a most extraordinary noise going on within a constant howling and sneezing and every now and then a great crash as if a dish or kettle had been
broken to pieces please then said alice how am i to get in there might be some sense in your knocking the footman went on without attending to her if we had the door
between us for instance if you were inside you might knock and i could let you out you know he was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking and this alice
thought decidedly uncivil but perhaps he cant help it she said to herself his eyes are so very nearly at the top of his head but at any rate he might answer questions
how am i to get in she repeated aloud i shall sit here the footman remarked till tomorrow at this moment the door of the house opened and a large plate came skimming
out straight at the footmans head it just grazed his nose and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him or next day maybe the footman continued in the same
tone exactly as if nothing had happened how am i to get in asked alice again in a louder tone are you to get in at all said the footman thats the first question you know
it was no doubt only alice did not like to be told so its really dreadful she muttered to herself the way all the creatures argue its enough to drive one crazy the
footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his remark with variations i shall sit here he said on and off for days and days but what am i to do said
alice anything you like said the footman and began whistling oh theres no use in talking to him said alice desperately hes perfectly idiotic and she opened the
door and went in the door led right into a large kitchen which was full of smoke from one end to the other the duchess was sitting on a three legged stool in the middle
nursing a baby the cook was leaning over the fire stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup theres certainly too much pepper in that soup alice said
to herself as well as she could for sneezing there was certainly too much of it in the air even the duchess sneezed occasionally and as for the baby it was sneezing
and howling alternately without a moments pause the only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze were the cook and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and
grinning from ear to ear please would you tell me said alice a little timidly for she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first why your cat
grins like that its a cheshire cat said the duchess and thats why pig she said the last word with such sudden violence that alice quite jumped but she saw in another
moment that it was addressed to the baby and not to her so she took courage and went on again i didnt know that cheshire cats always grinned in fact i didnt know that
cats could grin they all can said the duchess and most of em do i dont know of any that do alice said very politely feeling quite pleased to have got into a
conversation you dont know much said the duchess and thats a fact alice did not at all like the tone of this remark and thought it would be as well to introduce some
other subject of conversation while she was trying to fix on one the cook took the cauldron of soup off the fire and at once set to work throwing everything within
her reach at the duchess and the baby the fire irons came first then followed a shower of saucepans plates and dishes the duchess took no notice of them even when
they hit her and the baby was howling so much already that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not oh please mind what youre doing cried alice
jumping up and down in an agony of terror oh there goes his precious nose as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it and very nearly carried it off if everybody
minded their own business the duchess said in a hoarse growl the world would go round a deal faster than it does which would not be an advantage said alice who felt
very glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge just think of what work it would make with the day and night you see the earth takes twenty
four hours to turn round on its axis talking of axes said the duchess chop off her head alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook to see if she meant to take the hint
but the cook was busily stirring the soup and seemed not to be listening so she went on again twenty four hours i think or is it twelve i oh dont bother me said the
duchess i never could abide figures and with that she began nursing her child again singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so and giving it a violent shake at the
end of every line speak roughly to your little boy and beat him when he sneezes he only does it to annoy because he knows it teases in which the cook and the baby joined
wow wow wow while the duchess sang the second verse of the song she kept tossing the baby violently up and down and the poor little thing howled so that alice could
hardly hear the words i speak severely to my boy i beat him when he sneezes for he can thoroughly enjoy the pepper when he pleases wow wow wow here you may nurse it a bit
if you like the duchess said to alice flinging the baby at her as she spoke i must go and get ready to play croquet with the queen and she hurried out of the room the cook
threw a frying pan after her as she went out but it just missed her alice caught the baby with some difficulty as it was a queer shaped little creature and held out its
arms and legs in all directions just like a star fish thought alice the poor little thing was snorting like a steam engine when she caught it and kept doubling
itself up and straightening itself out again so that altogether for the first minute or two it was as much as she could do to hold it as soon as she had made out the
proper way of nursing it which was to twist it up into a sort of knot and then keep tight hold of its right ear and left foot so as to prevent its undoing itself she
carried it out into the open air if i dont take this child away with me thought alice theyre sure to kill it in a day or two wouldnt it be murder to leave it behind she
said the last words out loud and the little thing grunted in reply it had left off sneezing by this time dont grunt said alice thats not at all a proper way of
expressing yourself the baby grunted again and alice looked very anxiously into its face to see what was the matter with it there could be no doubt that it had a very
turn up nose much more like a snout than a real nose also its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby altogether alice did not like the look of the thing at all but
perhaps it was only sobbing she thought and looked into its eyes again to see if there were any tears no there were no tears if youre going to turn into a pig my dear
said alice seriously ill have nothing more to do with you mind now the poor little thing sobbed again or grunted it was impossible to say which and they went on for
some while in silence alice was just beginning to think to herself now what am i to do with this creature when i get it home when it grunted again so violently that she
looked down into its face in some alarm this time there could be no mistake about it it was neither more nor less than a pig and she felt that it would be quite absurd
for her to carry it further so she set the little creature down and felt quite relieved to see it trot away quietly into the wood if it had grown up she said to herself
it would have made a dreadfully ugly child but it makes rather a handsome pig i think and she began thinking over other children she knew who might do very well as
pigs and was just saying to herself if one only knew the right way to change them when she was a little startled by seeing the cheshire cat sitting on a bough of a tree a
few yards off the cat only grinned when it saw alice it looked good natured she thought still it had very long claws and a great many teeth so she felt that it ought to
be treated with respect cheshire puss she began rather timidly as she did not at all know whether it would like the name however it only grinned a little wider come
its pleased so far thought alice and she went on would you tell me please which way i ought to go from here that depends a good deal on where you want to get to said the
cat i dont much care where said alice then it doesnt matter which way you go said the cat so long as i get somewhere alice added as an explanation oh youre sure to do
that said the cat if you only walk long enough alice felt that this could not be denied so she tried another question what sort of people live about here in that
direction the cat said waving its right paw round lives a hatter and in that direction waving the other paw lives a march hare visit either you like theyre both mad
but i dont want to go among mad people alice remarked oh you cant help that said the cat were all mad here im mad youre mad how do you know im mad said alice you must be
said the cat or you wouldnt have come here alice didnt think that proved it at all however she went on and how do you know that youre mad to begin with said the cat a dogs
not mad you grant that i suppose so said alice well then the cat went on you see a dog growls when its angry and wags its tail when its pleased now i growl when im pleased
and wag my tail when im angry therefore im mad i call it purring not growling said alice call it what you like said the cat do you play croquet with the queen to day i
should like it very much said alice but i havent been invited yet youll see me there said the cat and vanished alice was not much surprised at this she was getting so
used to queer things happening while she was looking at the place where it had been it suddenly appeared again by the bye what became of the baby said the cat id
nearly forgotten to ask it turned into a pig alice quietly said just as if it had come back in a natural way i thought it would said the cat and vanished again alice
waited a little half expecting to see it again but it did not appear and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in which the march hare was said to live ive
seen hatters before she said to herself the march hare will be much the most interesting and perhaps as this is may it wont be raving mad at least not so mad as it was in
march as she said this she looked up and there was the cat again sitting on a branch of a tree did you say pig or fig said the cat i said pig replied alice and i wish you
wouldnt keep appearing and vanishing so suddenly you make one quite giddy all right said the cat and this time it vanished quite slowly beginning with the end of
the tail and ending with the grin which remained some time after the rest of it had gone well ive often seen a cat without a grin thought alice but a grin without a cat
its the most curious thing i ever saw in my life she had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of the march hare she thought it must be the right
house because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur it was so large a house that she did not like to go nearer till she had nibbled some
more of the lefthand bit of mushroom and raised herself to about two feet high even then she walked up towards it rather timidly saying to herself suppose it should
be raving mad after all i almost wish id gone to see the hatter instead there was a table set out under a tree in front of the house and the march hare and the hatter were
having tea at it a dormouse was sitting between them fast asleep and the other two were using it as a cushion resting their elbows on it and talking over its head very
uncomfortable for the dormouse thought alice only as its asleep i suppose it doesnt mind the table was a large one but the three were all crowded together at one
corner of it no room no room they cried out when they saw alice coming theres plenty of room said alice indignantly and she sat down in a large arm chair at one end of
the table have some wine the march hare said in an encouraging tone alice looked all round the table but there was nothing on it but tea i dont see any wine she
remarked there isnt any said the march hare then it wasnt very civil of you to offer it said alice angrily it wasnt very civil of you to sit down without being invited
said the march hare i didnt know it was your table said alice its laid for a great many more than three your hair wants cutting said the hatter he had been looking at
alice for some time with great curiosity and this was his first speech you should learn not to make personal remarks alice said with some severity its very rude the
hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this but all he said was why is a raven like a writing desk come we shall have some fun now thought alice im glad theyve
begun asking riddles i believe i can guess that she added aloud do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it said the march hare exactly so said alice
then you should say what you mean the march hare went on i do alice hastily replied at least at least i mean what i say thats the same thing you know not the same thing a
bit said the hatter you might just as well say that i see what i eat is the same thing as i eat what i see you might just as well say added the march hare that i like what i
get is the same thing as i get what i like you might just as well say added the dormouse who seemed to be talking in his sleep that i breathe when i sleep is the same thing
as i sleep when i breathe it is the same thing with you said the hatter and here the conversation dropped and the party sat silent for a minute while alice thought
over all she could remember about ravens and writing desks which wasnt much the hatter was the first to break the silence what day of the month is it he said turning
to alice he had taken his watch out of his pocket and was looking at it uneasily shaking it every now and then and holding it to his ear alice considered a little and
then said the fourth two days wrong sighed the hatter i told you butter wouldnt suit the works he added looking angrily at the march hare it was the best butter the
march hare meekly replied yes but some crumbs must have got in as well the hatter grumbled you shouldnt have put it in with the bread knife the march hare took the
watch and looked at it gloomily then he dipped it into his cup of tea and looked at it again but he could think of nothing better to say than his first remark it was the
best butter you know alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity what a funny watch she remarked it tells the day of the month and doesnt tell what
oclock it is why should it muttered the hatter does your watch tell you what year it is of course not alice replied very readily but thats because it stays the same
year for such a long time together which is just the case with mine said the hatter alice felt dreadfully puzzled the hatters remark seemed to have no sort of
meaning in it and yet it was certainly english i dont quite understand you she said as politely as she could the dormouse is asleep again said the hatter and he
poured a little hot tea upon its nose the dormouse shook its head impatiently and said without opening its eyes of course of course just what i was going to remark
myself have you guessed the riddle yet the hatter said turning to alice again no i give it up alice replied whats the answer i havent the slightest idea said the
hatter nor i said the march hare alice sighed wearily i think you might do something better with the time she said than waste it in asking riddles that have no
answers if you knew time as well as i do said the hatter you wouldnt talk about wasting it its him i dont know what you mean said alice of course you dont the hatter said
tossing his head contemptuously i dare say you never even spoke to time perhaps not alice cautiously replied but i know i have to beat time when i learn music ah that
accounts for it said the hatter he wont stand beating now if you only kept on good terms with him hed do almost anything you liked with the clock for instance suppose
it were nine oclock in the morning just time to begin lessons youd only have to whisper a hint to time and round goes the clock in a twinkling half past one time for
dinner i only wish it was the march hare said to itself in a whisper that would be grand certainly said alice thoughtfully but then i shouldnt be hungry for it you
know not at first perhaps said the hatter but you could keep it to half past one as long as you liked is that the way you manage alice asked the hatter shook his head
mournfully not i he replied we quarrelled last march just before he went mad you know pointing with his tea spoon at the march hare it was at the great concert given
by the queen of hearts and i had to sing twinkle twinkle little bat how i wonder what youre at you know the song perhaps ive heard something like it said alice it goes
on you know the hatter continued in this way up above the world you fly like a tea tray in the sky twinkle twinkle here the dormouse shook itself and began singing in
its sleep twinkle twinkle twinkle twinkle and went on so long that they had to pinch it to make it stop well id hardly finished the first verse said the hatter when
the queen jumped up and bawled out hes murdering the time off with his head how dreadfully savage exclaimed alice and ever since that the hatter went on in a
mournful tone he wont do a thing i ask its always six oclock now a bright idea came into alices head is that the reason so many tea things are put out here she asked yes
thats it said the hatter with a sigh its always tea time and weve no time to wash the things between whiles then you keep moving round i suppose said alice exactly so
said the hatter as the things get used up but what happens when you come to the beginning again alice ventured to ask suppose we change the subject the march hare
interrupted yawning im getting tired of this i vote the young lady tells us a story im afraid i dont know one said alice rather alarmed at the proposal then the
dormouse shall they both cried wake up dormouse and they pinched it on both sides at once the dormouse slowly opened his eyes i wasnt asleep he said in a hoarse
feeble voice i heard every word you fellows were saying tell us a story said the march hare yes please do pleaded alice and be quick about it added the hatter or youll
be asleep again before its done once upon a time there were three little sisters the dormouse began in a great hurry and their names were elsie lacie and tillie and
they lived at the bottom of a well what did they live on said alice who always took a great interest in questions of eating and drinking they lived on treacle said the
dormouse after thinking a minute or two they couldnt have done that you know alice gently remarked theyd have been ill so they were said the dormouse very ill alice
tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of living would be like but it puzzled her too much so she went on but why did they live at the bottom of a well
take some more tea the march hare said to alice very earnestly ive had nothing yet alice replied in an offended tone so i cant take more you mean you cant take less
said the hatter its very easy to take more than nothing nobody asked your opinion said alice whos making personal remarks now the hatter asked triumphantly alice
did not quite know what to say to this so she helped herself to some tea and bread and butter and then turned to the dormouse and repeated her question why did they
live at the bottom of a well the dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it and then said it was a treacle well theres no such thing alice was beginning very
angrily but the hatter and the march hare went sh sh and the dormouse sulkily remarked if you cant be civil youd better finish the story for yourself no please go on
alice said very humbly i wont interrupt again i dare say there may be one one indeed said the dormouse indignantly however he consented to go on and so these three
little sisters they were learning to draw you know what did they draw said alice quite forgetting her promise treacle said the dormouse without considering at
all this time i want a clean cup interrupted the hatter lets all move one place on he moved on as he spoke and the dormouse followed him the march hare moved into the
dormouses place and alice rather unwillingly took the place of the march hare the hatter was the only one who got any advantage from the change and alice was a good
deal worse off than before as the march hare had just upset the milk jug into his plate alice did not wish to offend the dormouse again so she began very cautiously
but i dont understand where did they draw the treacle from you can draw water out of a water well said the hatter so i should think you could draw treacle out of a
treacle well eh stupid but they were in the well alice said to the dormouse not choosing to notice this last remark of course they were said the dormouse well in this
answer so confused poor alice that she let the dormouse go on for some time without interrupting it they were learning to draw the dormouse went on yawning and
rubbing its eyes for it was getting very sleepy and they drew all manner of things everything that begins with an m why with an m said alice why not said the march hare
alice was silent the dormouse had closed its eyes by this time and was going off into a doze but on being pinched by the hatter it woke up again with a little shriek and
went on that begins with an m such as mouse traps and the moon and memory and muchness you know you say things are much of a muchness did you ever see such a thing as a
drawing of a muchness really now you ask me said alice very much confused i dont think then you shouldnt talk said the hatter this piece of rudeness was more than
alice could bear she got up in great disgust and walked off the dormouse fell asleep instantly and neither of the others took the least notice of her going though
she looked back once or twice half hoping that they would call after her the last time she saw them they were trying to put the dormouse into the teapot at any rate ill
never go there again said alice as she picked her way through the wood its the stupidest tea party i ever was at in all my life just as she said this she noticed that one
of the trees had a door leading right into it thats very curious she thought but everythings curious today i think i may as well go in at once and in she went once more
she found herself in the long hall and close to the little glass table now ill manage better this time she said to herself and began by taking the little golden key
and unlocking the door that led into the garden then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom she had kept a piece of it in her pocket till she was about a foot high
then she walked down the little passage and then she found herself at last in the beautiful garden among the bright flower beds and the cool fountains a large rose
tree stood near the entrance of the garden the roses growing on it were white but there were three gardeners at it busily painting them red alice thought this a very
curious thing and she went nearer to watch them and just as she came up to them she heard one of them say look out now five dont go splashing paint over me like that i
couldnt help it said five in a sulky tone seven jogged my elbow on which seven looked up and said thats right five always lay the blame on others youd better not talk
said five i heard the queen say only yesterday you deserved to be beheaded what for said the one who had spoken first thats none of your business two said seven yes it
is his business said five and ill tell him it was for bringing the cook tulip roots instead of onions seven flung down his brush and had just begun well of all the
unjust things when his eye chanced to fall upon alice as she stood watching them and he checked himself suddenly the others looked round also and all of them bowed
low would you tell me said alice a little timidly why you are painting those roses five and seven said nothing but looked at two two began in a low voice why the fact is
you see miss this here ought to have been a red rose tree and we put a white one in by mistake and if the queen was to find it out we should all have our heads cut off you
know so you see miss were doing our best afore she comes to at this moment five who had been anxiously looking across the garden called out the queen the queen and the
three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces there was a sound of many footsteps and alice looked round eager to see the queen first came ten
soldiers carrying clubs these were all shaped like the three gardeners oblong and flat with their hands and feet at the corners next the ten courtiers these were
ornamented all over with diamonds and walked two and two as the soldiers did after these came the royal children there were ten of them and the little dears came
jumping merrily along hand in hand in couples they were all ornamented with hearts next came the guests mostly kings and queens and among them alice recognised
the white rabbit it was talking in a hurried nervous manner smiling at everything that was said and went by without noticing her then followed the knave of hearts
carrying the kings crown on a crimson velvet cushion and last of all this grand procession came the king and queen of hearts alice was rather doubtful whether she
ought not to lie down on her face like the three gardeners but she could not remember ever having heard of such a rule at processions and besides what would be the use
of a procession thought she if people had all to lie down upon their faces so that they couldnt see it so she stood still where she was and waited when the procession
came opposite to alice they all stopped and looked at her and the queen said severely who is this she said it to the knave of hearts who only bowed and smiled in reply
idiot said the queen tossing her head impatiently and turning to alice she went on whats your name child my name is alice so please your majesty said alice very
politely but she added to herself why theyre only a pack of cards after all i neednt be afraid of them and who are these said the queen pointing to the three gardeners
who were lying round the rosetree for you see as they were lying on their faces and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the pack she could not tell
whether they were gardeners or soldiers or courtiers or three of her own children how should i know said alice surprised at her own courage its no business of mine
the queen turned crimson with fury and after glaring at her for a moment like a wild beast screamed off with her head off nonsense said alice very loudly and
decidedly and the queen was silent the king laid his hand upon her arm and timidly said consider my dear she is only a child the queen turned angrily away from him and
said to the knave turn them over the knave did so very carefully with one foot get up said the queen in a shrill loud voice and the three gardeners instantly jumped up
and began bowing to the king the queen the royal children and everybody else leave off that screamed the queen you make me giddy and then turning to the rose tree she
went on what have you been doing here may it please your majesty said two in a very humble tone going down on one knee as he spoke we were trying i see said the queen who
had meanwhile been examining the roses off with their heads and the procession moved on three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate
gardeners who ran to alice for protection you shant be beheaded said alice and she put them into a large flower pot that stood near the three soldiers wandered
about for a minute or two looking for them and then quietly marched off after the others are their heads off shouted the queen their heads are gone if it please your
majesty the soldiers shouted in reply thats right shouted the queen can you play croquet the soldiers were silent and looked at alice as the question was
evidently meant for her yes shouted alice come on then roared the queen and alice joined the procession wondering very much what would happen next its its a very
fine day said a timid voice at her side she was walking by the white rabbit who was peeping anxiously into her face very said alice wheres the duchess hush hush said
the rabbit in a low hurried tone he looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke and then raised himself upon tiptoe put his mouth close to her ear and whispered
shes under sentence of execution what for said alice did you say what a pity the rabbit asked no i didnt said alice i dont think its at all a pity i said what for she
boxed the queens ears the rabbit began alice gave a little scream of laughter oh hush the rabbit whispered in a frightened tone the queen will hear you you see she
came rather late and the queen said get to your places shouted the queen in a voice of thunder and people began running about in all directions tumbling up against
each other however they got settled down in a minute or two and the game began alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet ground in her life it was all
ridges and furrows the balls were live hedgehogs the mallets live flamingoes and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet to
make the arches the chief difficulty alice found at first was in managing her flamingo she succeeded in getting its body tucked away comfortably enough under her
arm with its legs hanging down but generally just as she had got its neck nicely straightened out and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head it would
twist itself round and look up in her face with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing and when she had got its head down and was
going to begin again it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself and was in the act of crawling away besides all this there was generally a
ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to and as the doubled up soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the
ground alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed the players all played at once without waiting for turns quarrelling all the
while and fighting for the hedgehogs and in a very short time the queen was in a furious passion and went stamping about and shouting off with his head or off with her
head about once in a minute alice began to feel very uneasy to be sure she had not as yet had any dispute with the queen but she knew that it might happen any minute and
then thought she what would become of me theyre dreadfully fond of beheading people here the great wonder is that theres any one left alive she was looking about
for some way of escape and wondering whether she could get away without being seen when she noticed a curious appearance in the air it puzzled her very much at first
but after watching it a minute or two she made it out to be a grin and she said to herself its the cheshire cat now i shall have somebody to talk to how are you getting on
said the cat as soon as there was mouth enough for it to speak with alice waited till the eyes appeared and then nodded its no use speaking to it she thought till its
ears have come or at least one of them in another minute the whole head appeared and then alice put down her flamingo and began an account of the game feeling very
glad she had someone to listen to her the cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight and no more of it appeared i dont think they play at all fairly
alice began in rather a complaining tone and they all quarrel so dreadfully one cant hear oneself speak and they dont seem to have any rules in particular at least
if there are nobody attends to them and youve no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive for instance theres the arch ive got to go through next walking
about at the other end of the ground and i should have croqueted the queens hedgehog just now only it ran away when it saw mine coming how do you like the queen said the
cat in a low voice not at all said alice shes so extremely just then she noticed that the queen was close behind her listening so she went on likely to win that its
hardly worth while finishing the game the queen smiled and passed on who are you talking to said the king going up to alice and looking at the cats head with great
curiosity its a friend of mine a cheshire cat said alice allow me to introduce it i dont like the look of it at all said the king however it may kiss my hand if it likes id
rather not the cat remarked dont be impertinent said the king and dont look at me like that he got behind alice as he spoke a cat may look at a king said alice ive read
that in some book but i dont remember where well it must be removed said the king very decidedly and he called the queen who was passing at the moment my dear i wish you
would have this cat removed the queen had only one way of settling all difficulties great or small off with his head she said without even looking round ill fetch
the executioner myself said the king eagerly and he hurried off alice thought she might as well go back and see how the game was going on as she heard the queens voice
in the distance screaming with passion she had already heard her sentence three of the players to be executed for having missed their turns and she did not like the
look of things at all as the game was in such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or not so she went in search of her hedgehog the hedgehog was engaged
in a fight with another hedgehog which seemed to alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other the only difficulty was that her
flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden where alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree by the time she had caught the
flamingo and brought it back the fight was over and both the hedgehogs were out of sight but it doesnt matter much thought alice as all the arches are gone from this
side of the ground so she tucked it away under her arm that it might not escape again and went back for a little more conversation with her friend when she got back to
the cheshire cat she was surprised to find quite a large crowd collected round it there was a dispute going on between the executioner the king and the queen who
were all talking at once while all the rest were quite silent and looked very uncomfortable the moment alice appeared she was appealed to by all three to settle the
question and they repeated their arguments to her though as they all spoke at once she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly what they said the executioners
argument was that you couldnt cut off a head unless there was a body to cut it off from that he had never had to do such a thing before and he wasnt going to begin at his
time of life the kings argument was that anything that had a head could be beheaded and that you werent to talk nonsense the queens argument was that if something
wasnt done about it in less than no time shed have everybody executed all round it was this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious alice
could think of nothing else to say but it belongs to the duchess youd better ask her about it shes in prison the queen said to the executioner fetch her here and the
executioner went off like an arrow the cats head began fading away the moment he was gone and by the time he had come back with the duchess it had entirely
disappeared so the king and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it while the rest of the party went back to the game you cant think how glad i am to see
you again you dear old thing said the duchess as she tucked her arm affectionately into alices and they walked off together alice was very glad to find her in such a
pleasant temper and thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so savage when they met in the kitchen when im a duchess she said to
herself not in a very hopeful tone though i wont have any pepper in my kitchen at all soup does very well without maybe its always pepper that makes people hot
tempered she went on very much pleased at having found out a new kind of rule and vinegar that makes them sour and camomile that makes them bitter and and barley
sugar and such things that make children sweet tempered i only wish people knew that then they wouldnt be so stingy about it you know she had quite forgotten the
duchess by this time and was a little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear youre thinking about something my dear and that makes you forget to talk i
cant tell you just now what the moral of that is but i shall remember it in a bit perhaps it hasnt one alice ventured to remark tut tut child said the duchess
everythings got a moral if only you can find it and she squeezed herself up closer to alices side as she spoke alice did not much like keeping so close to her first
because the duchess was very ugly and secondly because she was exactly the right height to rest her chin upon alices shoulder and it was an uncomfortably sharp
chin however she did not like to be rude so she bore it as well as she could the games going on rather better now she said by way of keeping up the conversation a little
tis so said the duchess and the moral of that is oh tis love tis love that makes the world go round somebody said alice whispered that its done by everybody minding
their own business ah well it means much the same thing said the duchess digging her sharp little chin into alices shoulder as she added and the moral of that is take
care of the sense and the sounds will take care of themselves how fond she is of finding morals in things alice thought to herself i dare say youre wondering why i
dont put my arm round your waist the duchess said after a pause the reason is that im doubtful about the temper of your flamingo shall i try the experiment he might
bite alice cautiously replied not feeling at all anxious to have the experiment tried very true said the duchess flamingoes and mustard both bite and the moral of
that is birds of a feather flock together only mustard isnt a bird alice remarked right as usual said the duchess what a clear way you have of putting things its a
mineral i think said alice of course it is said the duchess who seemed ready to agree to everything that alice said theres a large mustard mine near here and the
moral of that is the more there is of mine the less there is of yours oh i know exclaimed alice who had not attended to this last remark its a vegetable it doesnt look
like one but it is i quite agree with you said the duchess and the moral of that is be what you would seem to be or if youd like it put more simply never imagine yourself
not to be otherwise than what it might appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be
otherwise i think i should understand that better alice said very politely if i had it written down but i cant quite follow it as you say it thats nothing to what i
could say if i chose the duchess replied in a pleased tone pray dont trouble yourself to say it any longer than that said alice oh dont talk about trouble said the
duchess i make you a present of everything ive said as yet a cheap sort of present thought alice im glad they dont give birthday presents like that but she did not
venture to say it out loud thinking again the duchess asked with another dig of her sharp little chin ive a right to think said alice sharply for she was beginning to
feel a little worried just about as much right said the duchess as pigs have to fly and the m but here to alices great surprise the duchesss voice died away even in the
middle of her favourite word moral and the arm that was linked into hers began to tremble alice looked up and there stood the queen in front of them with her arms
folded frowning like a thunderstorm a fine day your majesty the duchess began in a low weak voice now i give you fair warning shouted the queen stamping on the
ground as she spoke either you or your head must be off and that in about half no time take your choice the duchess took her choice and was gone in a moment lets go on
with the game the queen said to alice and alice was too much frightened to say a word but slowly followed her back to the croquet ground the other guests had taken
advantage of the queens absence and were resting in the shade however the moment they saw her they hurried back to the game the queen merely remarking that a
moments delay would cost them their lives all the time they were playing the queen never left off quarrelling with the other players and shouting off with his head
or off with her head those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers who of course had to leave off being arches to do this so that by the end of half an
hour or so there were no arches left and all the players except the king the queen and alice were in custody and under sentence of execution then the queen left off
quite out of breath and said to alice have you seen the mock turtle yet no said alice i dont even know what a mock turtle is its the thing mock turtle soup is made from
said the queen i never saw one or heard of one said alice come on then said the queen and he shall tell you his history as they walked off together alice heard the king
say in a low voice to the company generally you are all pardoned come thats a good thing she said to herself for she had felt quite unhappy at the number of executions
the queen had ordered they very soon came upon a gryphon lying fast asleep in the sun if you dont know what a gryphon is look at the picture up lazy thing said the queen
and take this young lady to see the mock turtle and to hear his history i must go back and see after some executions i have ordered and she walked off leaving alice
alone with the gryphon alice did not quite like the look of the creature but on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage
queen so she waited the gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes then it watched the queen till she was out of sight then it chuckled what fun said the gryphon half to itself
half to alice what is the fun said alice why she said the gryphon its all her fancy that they never executes nobody you know come on everybody says come on here
thought alice as she went slowly after it i never was so ordered about in all my life never they had not gone far before they saw the mock turtle in the distance
sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock and as they came nearer alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break she pitied him deeply what is his
sorrow she asked the gryphon and the gryphon answered very nearly in the same words as before its all his fancy that he hasnt got no sorrow you know come on so they
went up to the mock turtle who looked at them with large eyes full of tears but said nothing this here young lady said the gryphon she wants for to know your history
she do ill tell it her said the mock turtle in a deep hollow tone sit down both of you and dont speak a word till ive finished so they sat down and nobody spoke for some
minutes alice thought to herself i dont see how he can ever finish if he doesnt begin but she waited patiently once said the mock turtle at last with a deep sigh i was a
real turtle these words were followed by a very long silence broken only by an occasional exclamation of hjckrrh from the gryphon and the constant heavy sobbing
of the mock turtle alice was very nearly getting up and saying thank you sir for your interesting story but she could not help thinking there must be more to come so
she sat still and said nothing when we were little the mock turtle went on at last more calmly though still sobbing a little now and then we went to school in the sea
the master was an old turtle we used to call him tortoise why did you call him tortoise if he wasnt one alice asked we called him tortoise because he taught us said the
mock turtle angrily really you are very dull you ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question added the gryphon and then they both sat silent
and looked at poor alice who felt ready to sink into the earth at last the gryphon said to the mock turtle drive on old fellow dont be all day about it and he went on in
these words yes we went to school in the sea though you maynt believe it i never said i didnt interrupted alice you did said the mock turtle hold your tongue added the
gryphon before alice could speak again the mock turtle went on we had the best of educations in fact we went to school every day ive been to a day school too said alice
you neednt be so proud as all that with extras asked the mock turtle a little anxiously yes said alice we learned french and music and washing said the mock turtle
certainly not said alice indignantly ah then yours wasnt a really good school said the mock turtle in a tone of great relief now at ours they had at the end of the bill
french music and washing extra you couldnt have wanted it much said alice living at the bottom of the sea i couldnt afford to learn it said the mock turtle with a sigh
i only took the regular course what was that inquired alice reeling and writhing of course to begin with the mock turtle replied and then the different branches of
arithmetic ambition distraction uglification and derision i never heard of uglification alice ventured to say what is it the gryphon lifted up both its paws in
surprise what never heard of uglifying it exclaimed you know what to beautify is i suppose yes said alice doubtfully it means to make anything prettier well then
the gryphon went on if you dont know what to uglify is you are a simpleton alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it so she turned to the mock
turtle and said what else had you to learn well there was mystery the mock turtle replied counting off the subjects on his flappers mystery ancient and modern with
seaography then drawling the drawling master was an old conger eel that used to come once a week he taught us drawling stretching and fainting in coils what was
that like said alice well i cant show it you myself the mock turtle said im too stiff and the gryphon never learnt it hadnt time said the gryphon i went to the classics
master though he was an old crab he was i never went to him the mock turtle said with a sigh he taught laughing and grief they used to say so he did so he did said the
gryphon sighing in his turn and both creatures hid their faces in their paws and how many hours a day did you do lessons said alice in a hurry to change the subject ten
hours the first day said the mock turtle nine the next and so on what a curious plan exclaimed alice thats the reason theyre called lessons the gryphon remarked
because they lessen from day to day this was quite a new idea to alice and she thought it over a little before she made her next remark then the eleventh day must have
been a holiday of course it was said the mock turtle and how did you manage on the twelfth alice went on eagerly thats enough about lessons the gryphon interrupted
in a very decided tone tell her something about the games now the mock turtle sighed deeply and drew the back of one flapper across his eyes he looked at alice and
tried to speak but for a minute or two sobs choked his voice same as if he had a bone in his throat said the gryphon and it set to work shaking him and punching him in the
back at last the mock turtle recovered his voice and with tears running down his cheeks he went on again you may not have lived much under the sea i havent said alice
and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster alice began to say i once tasted but checked herself hastily and said no never so you can have no idea what a
delightful thing a lobster quadrille is no indeed said alice what sort of a dance is it why said the gryphon you first form into a line along the sea shore two lines
cried the mock turtle seals turtles salmon and so on then when youve cleared all the jelly fish out of the way that generally takes some time interrupted the
gryphon you advance twice each with a lobster as a partner cried the gryphon of course the mock turtle said advance twice set to partners change lobsters and
retire in same order continued the gryphon then you know the mock turtle went on you throw the the lobsters shouted the gryphon with a bound into the air as far out to
sea as you can swim after them screamed the gryphon turn a somersault in the sea cried the mock turtle capering wildly about change lobsters again yelled the
gryphon at the top of its voice back to land again and thats all the first figure said the mock turtle suddenly dropping his voice and the two creatures who had been
jumping about like mad things all this time sat down again very sadly and quietly and looked at alice it must be a very pretty dance said alice timidly would you like
to see a little of it said the mock turtle very much indeed said alice come lets try the first figure said the mock turtle to the gryphon we can do without lobsters you
know which shall sing oh you sing said the gryphon ive forgotten the words so they began solemnly dancing round and round alice every now and then treading on her
toes when they passed too close and waving their forepaws to mark the time while the mock turtle sang this very slowly and sadly will you walk a little faster said a
whiting to a snail theres a porpoise close behind us and hes treading on my tail see how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance they are waiting on the
shingle will you come and join the dance will you wont you will you wont you will you join the dance will you wont you will you wont you wont you join the dance you can
really have no notion how delightful it will be when they take us up and throw us with the lobsters out to sea but the snail replied too far too far and gave a look
askance said he thanked the whiting kindly but he would not join the dance would not could not would not could not would not join the dance would not could not would
not could not could not join the dance what matters it how far we go his scaly friend replied there is another shore you know upon the other side the further off from
england the nearer is to france then turn not pale beloved snail but come and join the dance will you wont you will you wont you will you join the dance will you wont
you will you wont you wont you join the dance thank you its a very interesting dance to watch said alice feeling very glad that it was over at last and i do so like that
curious song about the whiting oh as to the whiting said the mock turtle they youve seen them of course yes said alice ive often seen them at dinn she checked herself
hastily i dont know where dinn may be said the mock turtle but if youve seen them so often of course you know what theyre like i believe so alice replied thoughtfully
they have their tails in their mouths and theyre all over crumbs youre wrong about the crumbs said the mock turtle crumbs would all wash off in the sea but they have
their tails in their mouths and the reason is here the mock turtle yawned and shut his eyes tell her about the reason and all that he said to the gryphon the reason is
said the gryphon that they would go with the lobsters to the dance so they got thrown out to sea so they had to fall a long way so they got their tails fast in their
mouths so they couldnt get them out again thats all thank you said alice its very interesting i never knew so much about a whiting before i can tell you more than that
if you like said the gryphon do you know why its called a whiting i never thought about it said alice why it does the boots and shoes the gryphon replied very solemnly
alice was thoroughly puzzled does the boots and shoes she repeated in a wondering tone why what are your shoes done with said the gryphon i mean what makes them so
shiny alice looked down at them and considered a little before she gave her answer theyre done with blacking i believe boots and shoes under the sea the gryphon
went on in a deep voice are done with a whiting now you know and what are they made of alice asked in a tone of great curiosity soles and eels of course the gryphon
replied rather impatiently any shrimp could have told you that if id been the whiting said alice whose thoughts were still running on the song id have said to the
porpoise keep back please we dont want you with us they were obliged to have him with them the mock turtle said no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise
wouldnt it really said alice in a tone of great surprise of course not said the mock turtle why if a fish came to me and told me he was going a journey i should say with
what porpoise dont you mean purpose said alice i mean what i say the mock turtle replied in an offended tone and the gryphon added come lets hear some of your
adventures i could tell you my adventures beginning from this morning said alice a little timidly but its no use going back to yesterday because i was a different
person then explain all that said the mock turtle no no the adventures first said the gryphon in an impatient tone explanations take such a dreadful time so alice
began telling them her adventures from the time when she first saw the white rabbit she was a little nervous about it just at first the two creatures got so close to
her one on each side and opened their eyes and mouths so very wide but she gained courage as she went on her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part
about her repeating you are old father william to the caterpillar and the words all coming different and then the mock turtle drew a long breath and said thats very
curious its all about as curious as it can be said the gryphon it all came different the mock turtle repeated thoughtfully i should like to hear her try and repeat
something now tell her to begin he looked at the gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of authority over alice stand up and repeat tis the voice of the sluggard
said the gryphon how the creatures order one about and make one repeat lessons thought alice i might as well be at school at once however she got up and began to
repeat it but her head was so full of the lobster quadrille that she hardly knew what she was saying and the words came very queer indeed tis the voice of the lobster i
heard him declare you have baked me too brown i must sugar my hair as a duck with its eyelids so he with his nose trims his belt and his buttons and turns out his toes
later editions continued as follows when the sands are all dry he is gay as a lark and will talk in contemptuous tones of the shark but when the tide rises and sharks
are around his voice has a timid and tremulous sound thats different from what i used to say when i was a child said the gryphon well i never heard it before said the
mock turtle but it sounds uncommon nonsense alice said nothing she had sat down with her face in her hands wondering if anything would ever happen in a natural way
again i should like to have it explained said the mock turtle she cant explain it said the gryphon hastily go on with the next verse but about his toes the mock turtle
persisted how could he turn them out with his nose you know its the first position in dancing alice said but was dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing and longed to
change the subject go on with the next verse the gryphon repeated impatiently it begins i passed by his garden alice did not dare to disobey though she felt sure it
would all come wrong and she went on in a trembling voice i passed by his garden and marked with one eye how the owl and the panther were sharing a pie later editions
continued as follows the panther took pie crust and gravy and meat while the owl had the dish as its share of the treat when the pie was all finished the owl as a boon
was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon while the panther received knife and fork with a growl and concluded the banquet what is the use of repeating all that
stuff the mock turtle interrupted if you dont explain it as you go on its by far the most confusing thing i ever heard yes i think youd better leave off said the
gryphon and alice was only too glad to do so shall we try another figure of the lobster quadrille the gryphon went on or would you like the mock turtle to sing you a
song oh a song please if the mock turtle would be so kind alice replied so eagerly that the gryphon said in a rather offended tone hm no accounting for tastes sing her
turtle soup will you old fellow the mock turtle sighed deeply and began in a voice sometimes choked with sobs to sing this beautiful soup so rich and green waiting
in a hot tureen who for such dainties would not stoop soup of the evening beautiful soup soup of the evening beautiful soup beau ootiful soo oop beau ootiful soo oop
soo oop of the e e evening beautiful beautiful soup beautiful soup who cares for fish game or any other dish who would not give all else for two pennyworth only of
beautiful soup pennyworth only of beautiful soup beau ootiful soo oop beau ootiful soo oop soo oop of the e e evening beautiful beauti ful soup chorus again cried
the gryphon and the mock turtle had just begun to repeat it when a cry of the trials beginning was heard in the distance come on cried the gryphon and taking alice by
the hand it hurried off without waiting for the end of the song what trial is it alice panted as she ran but the gryphon only answered come on and ran the faster while
more and more faintly came carried on the breeze that followed them the melancholy words soo oop of the e e evening beautiful beautiful soup the king and queen of
hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived with a great crowd assembled about them all sorts of little birds and beasts as well as the whole pack of cards
the knave was standing before them in chains with a soldier on each side to guard him and near the king was the white rabbit with a trumpet in one hand and a scroll of
parchment in the other in the very middle of the court was a table with a large dish of tarts upon it they looked so good that it made alice quite hungry to look at them i
wish theyd get the trial done she thought and hand round the refreshments but there seemed to be no chance of this so she began looking at everything about her to
pass away the time alice had never been in a court of justice before but she had read about them in books and she was quite pleased to find that she knew the name of
nearly everything there thats the judge she said to herself because of his great wig the judge by the way was the king and as he wore his crown over the wig look at the
frontispiece if you want to see how he did it he did not look at all comfortable and it was certainly not becoming and thats the jury box thought alice and those
twelve creatures she was obliged to say creatures you see because some of them were animals and some were birds i suppose they are the jurors she said this last word
two or three times over to herself being rather proud of it for she thought and rightly too that very few little girls of her age knew the meaning of it at all however
jury men would have done just as well the twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates what are they doing alice whispered to the gryphon they cant have
anything to put down yet before the trials begun theyre putting down their names the gryphon whispered in reply for fear they should forget them before the end of
the trial stupid things alice began in a loud indignant voice but she stopped hastily for the white rabbit cried out silence in the court and the king put on his
spectacles and looked anxiously round to make out who was talking alice could see as well as if she were looking over their shoulders that all the jurors were
writing down stupid things on their slates and she could even make out that one of them didnt know how to spell stupid and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him a
nice muddle their slatesll be in before the trials over thought alice one of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked this of course alice could not stand and she went
round the court and got behind him and very soon found an opportunity of taking it away she did it so quickly that the poor little juror it was bill the lizard could
not make out at all what had become of it so after hunting all about for it he was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day and this was of very little use
as it left no mark on the slate herald read the accusation said the king on this the white rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet and then unrolled the parchment
scroll and read as follows the queen of hearts she made some tarts all on a summer day the knave of hearts he stole those tarts and took them quite away consider your
verdict the king said to the jury not yet not yet the rabbit hastily interrupted theres a great deal to come before that call the first witness said the king and the
white rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet and called out first witness the first witness was the hatter he came in with a teacup in one hand and a piece of bread
and butter in the other i beg pardon your majesty he began for bringing these in but i hadnt quite finished my tea when i was sent for you ought to have finished said
the king when did you begin the hatter looked at the march hare who had followed him into the court arm in arm with the dormouse fourteenth of march i think it was he
said fifteenth said the march hare sixteenth added the dormouse write that down the king said to the jury and the jury eagerly wrote down all three dates on their
slates and then added them up and reduced the answer to shillings and pence take off your hat the king said to the hatter it isnt mine said the hatter stolen the king
exclaimed turning to the jury who instantly made a memorandum of the fact i keep them to sell the hatter added as an explanation ive none of my own im a hatter here the
queen put on her spectacles and began staring at the hatter who turned pale and fidgeted give your evidence said the king and dont be nervous or ill have you
executed on the spot this did not seem to encourage the witness at all he kept shifting from one foot to the other looking uneasily at the queen and in his confusion
he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the bread and butter just at this moment alice felt a very curious sensation which puzzled her a good deal until she
made out what it was she was beginning to grow larger again and she thought at first she would get up and leave the court but on second thoughts she decided to remain
where she was as long as there was room for her i wish you wouldnt squeeze so said the dormouse who was sitting next to her i can hardly breathe i cant help it said alice
very meekly im growing youve no right to grow here said the dormouse dont talk nonsense said alice more boldly you know youre growing too yes but i grow at a
reasonable pace said the dormouse not in that ridiculous fashion and he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the other side of the court all this time the queen
had never left off staring at the hatter and just as the dormouse crossed the court she said to one of the officers of the court bring me the list of the singers in the
last concert on which the wretched hatter trembled so that he shook both his shoes off give your evidence the king repeated angrily or ill have you executed
whether youre nervous or not im a poor man your majesty the hatter began in a trembling voice and i hadnt begun my tea not above a week or so and what with the bread and
butter getting so thin and the twinkling of the tea the twinkling of the what said the king it began with the tea the hatter replied of course twinkling begins with a
t said the king sharply do you take me for a dunce go on im a poor man the hatter went on and most things twinkled after that only the march hare said i didnt the march
hare interrupted in a great hurry you did said the hatter i deny it said the march hare he denies it said the king leave out that part well at any rate the dormouse said
the hatter went on looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too but the dormouse denied nothing being fast asleep after that continued the hatter i cut
some more bread and butter but what did the dormouse say one of the jury asked that i cant remember said the hatter you must remember remarked the king or ill have you
executed the miserable hatter dropped his teacup and bread and butter and went down on one knee im a poor man your majesty he began youre a very poor speaker said the
king here one of the guinea pigs cheered and was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court as that is rather a hard word i will just explain to you how it was
done they had a large canvas bag which tied up at the mouth with strings into this they slipped the guinea pig head first and then sat upon it im glad ive seen that done
thought alice ive so often read in the newspapers at the end of trials there was some attempts at applause which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the
court and i never understood what it meant till now if thats all you know about it you may stand down continued the king i cant go no lower said the hatter im on the
floor as it is then you may sit down the king replied here the other guinea pig cheered and was suppressed come that finished the guinea pigs thought alice now we
shall get on better id rather finish my tea said the hatter with an anxious look at the queen who was reading the list of singers you may go said the king and the hatter
hurriedly left the court without even waiting to put his shoes on and just take his head off outside the queen added to one of the officers but the hatter was out of
sight before the officer could get to the door call the next witness said the king the next witness was the duchesss cook she carried the pepper box in her hand and
alice guessed who it was even before she got into the court by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once give your evidence said the king shant said
the cook the king looked anxiously at the white rabbit who said in a low voice your majesty must cross examine this witness well if i must i must the king said with a
melancholy air and after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were nearly out of sight he said in a deep voice what are tarts made of pepper mostly
said the cook treacle said a sleepy voice behind her collar that dormouse the queen shrieked out behead that dormouse turn that dormouse out of court suppress him
pinch him off with his whiskers for some minutes the whole court was in confusion getting the dormouse turned out and by the time they had settled down again the
cook had disappeared never mind said the king with an air of great relief call the next witness and he added in an undertone to the queen really my dear you must cross
examine the next witness it quite makes my forehead ache alice watched the white rabbit as he fumbled over the list feeling very curious to see what the next
witness would be like for they havent got much evidence yet she said to herself imagine her surprise when the white rabbit read out at the top of his shrill little
voice the name alice here cried alice quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes and she jumped up in such a hurry
that she tipped over the jury box with the edge of her skirt upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below and there they lay sprawling about reminding
her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset the week before oh i beg your pardon she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay and began picking them up
again as quickly as she could for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head and she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once and put back
into the jury box or they would die the trial cannot proceed said the king in a very grave voice until all the jurymen are back in their proper places all he repeated
with great emphasis looking hard at alice as he said do alice looked at the jury box and saw that in her haste she had put the lizard in head downwards and the poor
little thing was waving its tail about in a melancholy way being quite unable to move she soon got it out again and put it right not that it signifies much she said to
herself i should think it would be quite as much use in the trial one way up as the other as soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being upset and
their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to them they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the accident all except the lizard who
seemed too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open gazing up into the roof of the court what do you know about this business the king said to alice
nothing said alice nothing whatever persisted the king nothing whatever said alice thats very important the king said turning to the jury they were just
beginning to write this down on their slates when the white rabbit interrupted unimportant your majesty means of course he said in a very respectful tone but
frowning and making faces at him as he spoke unimportant of course i meant the king hastily said and went on to himself in an undertone important unimportant
unimportant important as if he were trying which word sounded best some of the jury wrote it down important and some unimportant alice could see this as she was
near enough to look over their slates but it doesnt matter a bit she thought to herself at this moment the king who had been for some time busily writing in his note
book cackled out silence and read out from his book rule forty two all persons more than a mile high to leave the court everybody looked at alice im not a mile high
said alice you are said the king nearly two miles high added the queen well i shant go at any rate said alice besides thats not a regular rule you invented it just now
its the oldest rule in the book said the king then it ought to be number one said alice the king turned pale and shut his note book hastily consider your verdict he
said to the jury in a low trembling voice theres more evidence to come yet please your majesty said the white rabbit jumping up in a great hurry this paper has just
been picked up whats in it said the queen i havent opened it yet said the white rabbit but it seems to be a letter written by the prisoner to to somebody it must have
been that said the king unless it was written to nobody which isnt usual you know who is it directed to said one of the jurymen it isnt directed at all said the white
rabbit in fact theres nothing written on the outside he unfolded the paper as he spoke and added it isnt a letter after all its a set of verses are they in the
prisoners handwriting asked another of the jurymen no theyre not said the white rabbit and thats the queerest thing about it the jury all looked puzzled he must
have imitated somebody elses hand said the king the jury all brightened up again please your majesty said the knave i didnt write it and they cant prove i did theres
no name signed at the end if you didnt sign it said the king that only makes the matter worse you must have meant some mischief or else youd have signed your name like
an honest man there was a general clapping of hands at this it was the first really clever thing the king had said that day that proves his guilt said the queen it
proves nothing of the sort said alice why you dont even know what theyre about read them said the king the white rabbit put on his spectacles where shall i begin
please your majesty he asked begin at the beginning the king said gravely and go on till you come to the end then stop these were the verses the white rabbit read they
told me you had been to her and mentioned me to him she gave me a good character but said i could not swim he sent them word i had not gone we know it to be true if she should
push the matter on what would become of you i gave her one they gave him two you gave us three or more they all returned from him to you though they were mine before if i
or she should chance to be involved in this affair he trusts to you to set them free exactly as we were my notion was that you had been before she had this fit an
obstacle that came between him and ourselves and it dont let him know she liked them best for this must ever be a secret kept from all the rest between yourself and me
thats the most important piece of evidence weve heard yet said the king rubbing his hands so now let the jury if any one of them can explain it said alice she had grown
so large in the last few minutes that she wasnt a bit afraid of interrupting him ill give him sixpence i dont believe theres an atom of meaning in it the jury all wrote
down on their slates she doesnt believe theres an atom of meaning in it but none of them attempted to explain the paper if theres no meaning in it said the king that
saves a world of trouble you know as we neednt try to find any and yet i dont know he went on spreading out the verses on his knee and looking at them with one eye i seem to
see some meaning in them after all said i could not swim you cant swim can you he added turning to the knave the knave shook his head sadly do i look like it he said which
he certainly did not being made entirely of cardboard all right so far said the king and he went on muttering over the verses to himself we know it to be true thats the
jury of course i gave her one they gave him two why that must be what he did with the tarts you know but it goes on they all returned from him to you said alice why there
they are said the king triumphantly pointing to the tarts on the table nothing can be clearer than that then again before she had this fit you never had fits my dear i
think he said to the queen never said the queen furiously throwing an inkstand at the lizard as she spoke the unfortunate little bill had left off writing on his
slate with one finger as he found it made no mark but he now hastily began again using the ink that was trickling down his face as long as it lasted then the words dont
fit you said the king looking round the court with a smile there was a dead silence its a pun the king added in an offended tone and everybody laughed let the jury
consider their verdict the king said for about the twentieth time that day no no said the queen sentence first verdict afterwards stuff and nonsense said alice
loudly the idea of having the sentence first hold your tongue said the queen turning purple i wont said alice off with her head the queen shouted at the top of her
voice nobody moved who cares for you said alice she had grown to her full size by this time youre nothing but a pack of cards at this the whole pack rose up into the air
and came flying down upon her she gave a little scream half of fright and half of anger and tried to beat them off and found herself lying on the bank with her head in
the lap of her sister who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face wake up alice dear said her sister why what a
long sleep youve had oh ive had such a curious dream said alice and she told her sister as well as she could remember them all these strange adventures of hers that
you have just been reading about and when she had finished her sister kissed her and said it was a curious dream dear certainly but now run in to your tea its getting
late so alice got up and ran off thinking while she ran as well she might what a wonderful dream it had been but her sister sat still just as she left her leaning her
head on her hand watching the setting sun and thinking of little alice and all her wonderful adventures till she too began dreaming after a fashion and this was her
dream first she dreamed of little alice herself and once again the tiny hands were clasped upon her knee and the bright eager eyes were looking up into hers she
could hear the very tones of her voice and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that would always get into her eyes and still as she
listened or seemed to listen the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures of her little sisters dream the long grass rustled at her feet as
the white rabbit hurried by the frightened mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool she could hear the rattle of the teacups as the march hare and his
friends shared their never ending meal and the shrill voice of the queen ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution once more the pig baby was sneezing on
the duchesss knee while plates and dishes crashed around it once more the shriek of the gryphon the squeaking of the lizards slate pencil and the choking of the
suppressed guinea pigs filled the air mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable mock turtle so she sat on with closed eyes and half believed herself in
wonderland though she knew she had but to open them again and all would change to dull reality the grass would be only rustling in the wind and the pool rippling to
the waving of the reeds the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep bells and the queens shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd boy and the sneeze of the
baby the shriek of the gryphon and all the other queer noises would change she knew to the confused clamour of the busy farm yard while the lowing of the cattle in the
distance would take the place of the mock turtles heavy sobs lastly she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would in the after time be herself a
grown woman and how she would keep through all her riper years the simple and loving heart of her childhood and how she would gather about her other little children
and make their eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale perhaps even with the dream of wonderland of long ago and how she would feel with all their simple
sorrows and find a pleasure in all their simple joys remembering her own child life and the happy summer days she was awakened by a shock so sudden and severe that if
dorothy had not been lying on the soft bed she might have been hurt as it was the jar made her catch her breath and wonder what had happened and toto put his cold little
nose into her face and whined dismally dorothy sat up and noticed that the house was not moving nor was it dark for the bright sunshine came in at the window flooding
the little room she sprang from her bed and with toto at her heels ran and opened the door the little girl gave a cry of amazement and looked about her her eyes growing
bigger and bigger at the wonderful sights she saw the cyclone had set the house down very gently for a cyclone in the midst of a country of marvelous beauty there
were lovely patches of greensward all about with stately trees bearing rich and luscious fruits banks of gorgeous flowers were on every hand and birds with rare
and brilliant plumage sang and fluttered in the trees and bushes a little way off was a small brook rushing and sparkling along between green banks and murmuring
in a voice very grateful to a little girl who had lived so long on the dry gray prairies while she stood looking eagerly at the strange and beautiful sights she
noticed coming toward her a group of the queerest people she had ever seen they were not as big as the grown folk she had always been used to but neither were they very
small in fact they seemed about as tall as dorothy who was a well grown child for her age although they were so far as looks go many years older three were men and one a
woman and all were oddly dressed they wore round hats that rose to a small point a foot above their heads with little bells around the brims that tinkled sweetly as
they moved the hats of the men were blue the little womans hat was white and she wore a white gown that hung in pleats from her shoulders over it were sprinkled little
stars that glistened in the sun like diamonds the men were dressed in blue of the same shade as their hats and wore well polished boots with a deep roll of blue at the
tops the men dorothy thought were about as old as uncle henry for two of them had beards but the little woman was doubtless much older her face was covered with
wrinkles her hair was nearly white and she walked rather stiffly when these people drew near the house where dorothy was standing in the doorway they paused and
whispered among themselves as if afraid to come farther but the little old woman walked up to dorothy made a low bow and said in a sweet voice you are welcome most
noble sorceress to the land of the munchkins we are so grateful to you for having killed the wicked witch of the east and for setting our people free from bondage
dorothy listened to this speech with wonder what could the little woman possibly mean by calling her a sorceress and saying she had killed the wicked witch of the
east dorothy was an innocent harmless little girl who had been carried by a cyclone many miles from home and she had never killed anything in all her life but the
little woman evidently expected her to answer so dorothy said with hesitation you are very kind but there must be some mistake i have not killed anything your
house did anyway replied the little old woman with a laugh and that is the same thing see she continued pointing to the corner of the house there are her two feet
still sticking out from under a block of wood dorothy looked and gave a little cry of fright there indeed just under the corner of the great beam the house rested on
two feet were sticking out shod in silver shoes with pointed toes oh dear oh dear cried dorothy clasping her hands together in dismay the house must have fallen on
her whatever shall we do there is nothing to be done said the little woman calmly but who was she asked dorothy she was the wicked witch of the east as i said answered
the little woman she has held all the munchkins in bondage for many years making them slave for her night and day now they are all set free and are grateful to you for
the favor who are the munchkins inquired dorothy they are the people who live in this land of the east where the wicked witch ruled are you a munchkin asked dorothy
no but i am their friend although i live in the land of the north when they saw the witch of the east was dead the munchkins sent a swift messenger to me and i came at once
i am the witch of the north oh gracious cried dorothy are you a real witch yes indeed answered the little woman but i am a good witch and the people love me i am not as
powerful as the wicked witch was who ruled here or i should have set the people free myself but i thought all witches were wicked said the girl who was half
frightened at facing a real witch oh no that is a great mistake there were only four witches in all the land of oz and two of them those who live in the north and the
south are good witches i know this is true for i am one of them myself and cannot be mistaken those who dwelt in the east and the west were indeed wicked witches but now
that you have killed one of them there is but one wicked witch in all the land of oz the one who lives in the west but said dorothy after a moments thought aunt em has
told me that the witches were all dead years and years ago who is aunt em inquired the little old woman she is my aunt who lives in kansas where i came from the witch of
the north seemed to think for a time with her head bowed and her eyes upon the ground then she looked up and said i do not know where kansas is for i have never heard that
country mentioned before but tell me is it a civilized country oh yes replied dorothy then that accounts for it in the civilized countries i believe there are no
witches left nor wizards nor sorceresses nor magicians but you see the land of oz has never been civilized for we are cut off from all the rest of the world therefore
we still have witches and wizards amongst us who are the wizards asked dorothy oz himself is the great wizard answered the witch sinking her voice to a whisper he is
more powerful than all the rest of us together he lives in the city of emeralds dorothy was going to ask another question but just then the munchkins who had been
standing silently by gave a loud shout and pointed to the corner of the house where the wicked witch had been lying what is it asked the little old woman and looked
and began to laugh the feet of the dead witch had disappeared entirely and nothing was left but the silver shoes she was so old explained the witch of the north that
she dried up quickly in the sun that is the end of her but the silver shoes are yours and you shall have them to wear she reached down and picked up the shoes and after
shaking the dust out of them handed them to dorothy the witch of the east was proud of those silver shoes said one of the munchkins and there is some charm connected
with them but what it is we never knew dorothy carried the shoes into the house and placed them on the table then she came out again to the munchkins and said i am
anxious to get back to my aunt and uncle for i am sure they will worry about me can you help me find my way the munchkins and the witch first looked at one another and
then at dorothy and then shook their heads at the east not far from here said one there is a great desert and none could live to cross it it is the same at the south said
another for i have been there and seen it the south is the country of the quadlings i am told said the third man that it is the same at the west and that country where the
winkies live is ruled by the wicked witch of the west who would make you her slave if you passed her way the north is my home said the old lady and at its edge is the same
great desert that surrounds this land of oz im afraid my dear you will have to live with us dorothy began to sob at this for she felt lonely among all these strange
people her tears seemed to grieve the kind hearted munchkins for they immediately took out their handkerchiefs and began to weep also as for the little old woman
she took off her cap and balanced the point on the end of her nose while she counted one two three in a solemn voice at once the cap changed to a slate on which was
written in big white chalk marks let dorothy go to the city of emeralds the little old woman took the slate from her nose and having read the words on it asked is your
name dorothy my dear yes answered the child looking up and drying her tears then you must go to the city of emeralds perhaps oz will help you where is this city asked
dorothy it is exactly in the center of the country and is ruled by oz the great wizard i told you of is he a good man inquired the girl anxiously he is a good wizard
whether he is a man or not i cannot tell for i have never seen him how can i get there asked dorothy you must walk it is a long journey through a country that is sometimes
pleasant and sometimes dark and terrible however i will use all the magic arts i know of to keep you from harm wont you go with me pleaded the girl who had begun to look
upon the little old woman as her only friend no i cannot do that she replied but i will give you my kiss and no one will dare injure a person who has been kissed by the
witch of the north she came close to dorothy and kissed her gently on the forehead where her lips touched the girl they left a round shining mark as dorothy found out
soon after the road to the city of emeralds is paved with yellow brick said the witch so you cannot miss it when you get to oz do not be afraid of him but tell your story
and ask him to help you good bye my dear the three munchkins bowed low to her and wished her a pleasant journey after which they walked away through the trees the
witch gave dorothy a friendly little nod whirled around on her left heel three times and straightway disappeared much to the surprise of little toto who barked
after her loudly enough when she had gone because he had been afraid even to growl while she stood by but dorothy knowing her to be a witch had expected her to
disappear in just that way and was not surprised in the least when dorothy was left alone she began to feel hungry so she went to the cupboard and cut herself some
bread which she spread with butter she gave some to toto and taking a pail from the shelf she carried it down to the little brook and filled it with clear sparkling
water toto ran over to the trees and began to bark at the birds sitting there dorothy went to get him and saw such delicious fruit hanging from the branches that she
gathered some of it finding it just what she wanted to help out her breakfast then she went back to the house and having helped herself and toto to a good drink of the
cool clear water she set about making ready for the journey to the city of emeralds dorothy had only one other dress but that happened to be clean and was hanging on a
peg beside her bed it was gingham with checks of white and blue and although the blue was somewhat faded with many washings it was still a pretty frock the girl
washed herself carefully dressed herself in the clean gingham and tied her pink sunbonnet on her head she took a little basket and filled it with bread from the
cupboard laying a white cloth over the top then she looked down at her feet and noticed how old and worn her shoes were they surely will never do for a long journey
toto she said and toto looked up into her face with his little black eyes and wagged his tail to show he knew what she meant at that moment dorothy saw lying on the
table the silver shoes that had belonged to the witch of the east i wonder if they will fit me she said to toto they would be just the thing to take a long walk in for they
could not wear out she took off her old leather shoes and tried on the silver ones which fitted her as well as if they had been made for her finally she picked up her
basket come along toto she said we will go to the emerald city and ask the great oz how to get back to kansas again she closed the door locked it and put the key
carefully in the pocket of her dress and so with toto trotting along soberly behind her she started on her journey there were several roads nearby but it did not
take her long to find the one paved with yellow bricks within a short time she was walking briskly toward the emerald city her silver shoes tinkling merrily on the
hard yellow road bed the sun shone bright and the birds sang sweetly and dorothy did not feel nearly so bad as you might think a little girl would who had been
suddenly whisked away from her own country and set down in the midst of a strange land she was surprised as she walked along to see how pretty the country was about
her there were neat fences at the sides of the road painted a dainty blue color and beyond them were fields of grain and vegetables in abundance evidently the
munchkins were good farmers and able to raise large crops once in a while she would pass a house and the people came out to look at her and bow low as she went by for
everyone knew she had been the means of destroying the wicked witch and setting them free from bondage the houses of the munchkins were odd looking dwellings for
each was round with a big dome for a roof all were painted blue for in this country of the east blue was the favorite color toward evening when dorothy was tired with
her long walk and began to wonder where she should pass the night she came to a house rather larger than the rest on the green lawn before it many men and women were
dancing five little fiddlers played as loudly as possible and the people were laughing and singing while a big table near by was loaded with delicious fruits and
nuts pies and cakes and many other good things to eat the people greeted dorothy kindly and invited her to supper and to pass the night with them for this was the home
of one of the richest munchkins in the land and his friends were gathered with him to celebrate their freedom from the bondage of the wicked witch dorothy ate a
hearty supper and was waited upon by the rich munchkin himself whose name was boq then she sat upon a settee and watched the people dance when boq saw her silver
shoes he said you must be a great sorceress why asked the girl because you wear silver shoes and have killed the wicked witch besides you have white in your frock and
only witches and sorceresses wear white my dress is blue and white checked said dorothy smoothing out the wrinkles in it it is kind of you to wear that said boq blue
is the color of the munchkins and white is the witch color so we know you are a friendly witch dorothy did not know what to say to this for all the people seemed to think
her a witch and she knew very well she was only an ordinary little girl who had come by the chance of a cyclone into a strange land when she had tired watching the
dancing boq led her into the house where he gave her a room with a pretty bed in it the sheets were made of blue cloth and dorothy slept soundly in them till morning
with toto curled up on the blue rug beside her she ate a hearty breakfast and watched a wee munchkin baby who played with toto and pulled his tail and crowed and
laughed in a way that greatly amused dorothy toto was a fine curiosity to all the people for they had never seen a dog before how far is it to the emerald city the girl
asked i do not know answered boq gravely for i have never been there it is better for people to keep away from oz unless they have business with him but it is a long way
to the emerald city and it will take you many days the country here is rich and pleasant but you must pass through rough and dangerous places before you reach the end
of your journey this worried dorothy a little but she knew that only the great oz could help her get to kansas again so she bravely resolved not to turn back she bade
her friends good bye and again started along the road of yellow brick when she had gone several miles she thought she would stop to rest and so climbed to the top of
the fence beside the road and sat down there was a great cornfield beyond the fence and not far away she saw a scarecrow placed high on a pole to keep the birds from the
ripe corn dorothy leaned her chin upon her hand and gazed thoughtfully at the scarecrow its head was a small sack stuffed with straw with eyes nose and mouth
painted on it to represent a face an old pointed blue hat that had belonged to some munchkin was perched on his head and the rest of the figure was a blue suit of
clothes worn and faded which had also been stuffed with straw on the feet were some old boots with blue tops such as every man wore in this country and the figure was
raised above the stalks of corn by means of the pole stuck up its back while dorothy was looking earnestly into the queer painted face of the scarecrow she was
surprised to see one of the eyes slowly wink at her she thought she must have been mistaken at first for none of the scarecrows in kansas ever wink but presently the
figure nodded its head to her in a friendly way then she climbed down from the fence and walked up to it while toto ran around the pole and barked good day said the
scarecrow in a rather husky voice did you speak asked the girl in wonder certainly answered the scarecrow how do you do im pretty well thank you replied dorothy
politely how do you do im not feeling well said the scarecrow with a smile for it is very tedious being perched up here night and day to scare away crows cant you get
down asked dorothy no for this pole is stuck up my back if you will please take away the pole i shall be greatly obliged to you dorothy reached up both arms and lifted
the figure off the pole for being stuffed with straw it was quite light thank you very much said the scarecrow when he had been set down on the ground i feel like a new
man dorothy was puzzled at this for it sounded queer to hear a stuffed man speak and to see him bow and walk along beside her who are you asked the scarecrow when he had
stretched himself and yawned and where are you going my name is dorothy said the girl and i am going to the emerald city to ask the great oz to send me back to kansas
where is the emerald city he inquired and who is oz why dont you know she returned in surprise no indeed i dont know anything you see i am stuffed so i have no brains at
all he answered sadly oh said dorothy im awfully sorry for you do you think he asked if i go to the emerald city with you that oz would give me some brains i cannot tell
she returned but you may come with me if you like if oz will not give you any brains you will be no worse off than you are now that is true said the scarecrow you see he
continued confidentially i dont mind my legs and arms and body being stuffed because i cannot get hurt if anyone treads on my toes or sticks a pin into me it doesnt
matter for i cant feel it but i do not want people to call me a fool and if my head stays stuffed with straw instead of with brains as yours is how am i ever to know
anything i understand how you feel said the little girl who was truly sorry for him if you will come with me ill ask oz to do all he can for you thank you he answered
gratefully they walked back to the road dorothy helped him over the fence and they started along the path of yellow brick for the emerald city toto did not like this
addition to the party at first he smelled around the stuffed man as if he suspected there might be a nest of rats in the straw and he often growled in an unfriendly way
at the scarecrow dont mind toto said dorothy to her new friend he never bites oh im not afraid replied the scarecrow he cant hurt the straw do let me carry that basket
for you i shall not mind it for i cant get tired ill tell you a secret he continued as he walked along there is only one thing in the world i am afraid of what is that asked
dorothy the munchkin farmer who made you no answered the scarecrow its a lighted match after a few hours the road began to be rough and the walking grew so difficult
that the scarecrow often stumbled over the yellow bricks which were here very uneven sometimes indeed they were broken or missing altogether leaving holes that
toto jumped across and dorothy walked around as for the scarecrow having no brains he walked straight ahead and so stepped into the holes and fell at full length on
the hard bricks it never hurt him however and dorothy would pick him up and set him upon his feet again while he joined her in laughing merrily at his own mishap the
farms were not nearly so well cared for here as they were farther back there were fewer houses and fewer fruit trees and the farther they went the more dismal and
lonesome the country became at noon they sat down by the roadside near a little brook and dorothy opened her basket and got out some bread she offered a piece to the
scarecrow but he refused i am never hungry he said and it is a lucky thing i am not for my mouth is only painted and if i should cut a hole in it so i could eat the straw i am
stuffed with would come out and that would spoil the shape of my head dorothy saw at once that this was true so she only nodded and went on eating her bread tell me
something about yourself and the country you came from said the scarecrow when she had finished her dinner so she told him all about kansas and how gray everything
was there and how the cyclone had carried her to this queer land of oz the scarecrow listened carefully and said i cannot understand why you should wish to leave
this beautiful country and go back to the dry gray place you call kansas that is because you have no brains answered the girl no matter how dreary and gray our homes
are we people of flesh and blood would rather live there than in any other country be it ever so beautiful there is no place like home the scarecrow sighed of course i
cannot understand it he said if your heads were stuffed with straw like mine you would probably all live in the beautiful places and then kansas would have no
people at all it is fortunate for kansas that you have brains wont you tell me a story while we are resting asked the child the scarecrow looked at her reproachfully
and answered my life has been so short that i really know nothing whatever i was only made day before yesterday what happened in the world before that time is all
unknown to me luckily when the farmer made my head one of the first things he did was to paint my ears so that i heard what was going on there was another munchkin with
him and the first thing i heard was the farmer saying how do you like those ears they arent straight answered the other never mind said the farmer they are ears just
the same which was true enough now ill make the eyes said the farmer so he painted my right eye and as soon as it was finished i found myself looking at him and at
everything around me with a great deal of curiosity for this was my first glimpse of the world thats a rather pretty eye remarked the munchkin who was watching the
farmer blue paint is just the color for eyes i think ill make the other a little bigger said the farmer and when the second eye was done i could see much better than
before then he made my nose and my mouth but i did not speak because at that time i didnt know what a mouth was for i had the fun of watching them make my body and my arms
and legs and when they fastened on my head at last i felt very proud for i thought i was just as good a man as anyone this fellow will scare the crows fast enough said the
farmer he looks just like a man why he is a man said the other and i quite agreed with him the farmer carried me under his arm to the cornfield and set me up on a tall stick
where you found me he and his friend soon after walked away and left me alone i did not like to be deserted this way so i tried to walk after them but my feet would not
touch the ground and i was forced to stay on that pole it was a lonely life to lead for i had nothing to think of having been made such a little while before many crows
and other birds flew into the cornfield but as soon as they saw me they flew away again thinking i was a munchkin and this pleased me and made me feel that i was quite an
important person by and by an old crow flew near me and after looking at me carefully he perched upon my shoulder and said i wonder if that farmer thought to fool me in
this clumsy manner any crow of sense could see that you are only stuffed with straw then he hopped down at my feet and ate all the corn he wanted the other birds seeing
he was not harmed by me came to eat the corn too so in a short time there was a great flock of them about me i felt sad at this for it showed i was not such a good scarecrow
after all but the old crow comforted me saying if you only had brains in your head you would be as good a man as any of them and a better man than some of them brains are
the only things worth having in this world no matter whether one is a crow or a man after the crows had gone i thought this over and decided i would try hard to get some
brains by good luck you came along and pulled me off the stake and from what you say i am sure the great oz will give me brains as soon as we get to the emerald city i hope
so said dorothy earnestly since you seem anxious to have them oh yes i am anxious returned the scarecrow it is such an uncomfortable feeling to know one is a fool
well said the girl let us go and she handed the basket to the scarecrow there were no fences at all by the roadside now and the land was rough and untilled toward
evening they came to a great forest where the trees grew so big and close together that their branches met over the road of yellow brick it was almost dark under the
trees for the branches shut out the daylight but the travelers did not stop and went on into the forest if this road goes in it must come out said the scarecrow and as
the emerald city is at the other end of the road we must go wherever it leads us anyone would know that said dorothy certainly that is why i know it returned the
scarecrow if it required brains to figure it out i never should have said it after an hour or so the light faded away and they found themselves stumbling along in the
darkness dorothy could not see at all but toto could for some dogs see very well in the dark and the scarecrow declared he could see as well as by day so she took hold of
his arm and managed to get along fairly well if you see any house or any place where we can pass the night she said you must tell me for it is very uncomfortable walking
in the dark soon after the scarecrow stopped i see a little cottage at the right of us he said built of logs and branches shall we go there yes indeed answered the
child i am all tired out so the scarecrow led her through the trees until they reached the cottage and dorothy entered and found a bed of dried leaves in one corner
she lay down at once and with toto beside her soon fell into a sound sleep the scarecrow who was never tired stood up in another corner and waited patiently until
morning came when dorothy awoke the sun was shining through the trees and toto had long been out chasing birds around him and squirrels she sat up and looked around
her there was the scarecrow still standing patiently in his corner waiting for her we must go and search for water she said to him why do you want water he asked to
wash my face clean after the dust of the road and to drink so the dry bread will not stick in my throat it must be inconvenient to be made of flesh said the scarecrow
thoughtfully for you must sleep and eat and drink however you have brains and it is worth a lot of bother to be able to think properly they left the cottage and walked
through the trees until they found a little spring of clear water where dorothy drank and bathed and ate her breakfast she saw there was not much bread left in the
basket and the girl was thankful the scarecrow did not have to eat anything for there was scarcely enough for herself and toto for the day when she had finished her
meal and was about to go back to the road of yellow brick she was startled to hear a deep groan near by what was that she asked timidly i cannot imagine replied the
scarecrow but we can go and see just then another groan reached their ears and the sound seemed to come from behind them they turned and walked through the forest a
few steps when dorothy discovered something shining in a ray of sunshine that fell between the trees she ran to the place and then stopped short with a little cry of
surprise one of the big trees had been partly chopped through and standing beside it with an uplifted axe in his hands was a man made entirely of tin his head and arms
and legs were jointed upon his body but he stood perfectly motionless as if he could not stir at all dorothy looked at him in amazement and so did the scarecrow while
toto barked sharply and made a snap at the tin legs which hurt his teeth did you groan asked dorothy yes answered the tin man i did ive been groaning for more than a
year and no one has ever heard me before or come to help me what can i do for you she inquired softly for she was moved by the sad voice in which the man spoke get an oil can
and oil my joints he answered they are rusted so badly that i cannot move them at all if i am well oiled i shall soon be all right again you will find an oil can on a shelf
in my cottage dorothy at once ran back to the cottage and found the oil can and then she returned and asked anxiously where are your joints oil my neck first replied
the tin woodman so she oiled it and as it was quite badly rusted the scarecrow took hold of the tin head and moved it gently from side to side until it worked freely and
then the man could turn it himself now oil the joints in my arms he said and dorothy oiled them and the scarecrow bent them carefully until they were quite free from
rust and as good as new the tin woodman gave a sigh of satisfaction and lowered his axe which he leaned against the tree this is a great comfort he said i have been
holding that axe in the air ever since i rusted and im glad to be able to put it down at last now if you will oil the joints of my legs i shall be all right once more so they
oiled his legs until he could move them freely and he thanked them again and again for his release for he seemed a very polite creature and very grateful i might have
stood there always if you had not come along he said so you have certainly saved my life how did you happen to be here we are on our way to the emerald city to see the
great oz she answered and we stopped at your cottage to pass the night why do you wish to see oz he asked i want him to send me back to kansas and the scarecrow wants him
to put a few brains into his head she replied the tin woodman appeared to think deeply for a moment then he said do you suppose oz could give me a heart why i guess so
dorothy answered it would be as easy as to give the scarecrow brains true the tin woodman returned so if you will allow me to join your party i will also go to the
emerald city and ask oz to help me come along said the scarecrow heartily and dorothy added that she would be pleased to have his company so the tin woodman
shouldered his axe and they all passed through the forest until they came to the road that was paved with yellow brick the tin woodman had asked dorothy to put the
oil can in her basket for he said if i should get caught in the rain and rust again i would need the oil can badly it was a bit of good luck to have their new comrade join
the party for soon after they had begun their journey again they came to a place where the trees and branches grew so thick over the road that the travelers could not
pass but the tin woodman set to work with his axe and chopped so well that soon he cleared a passage for the entire party dorothy was thinking so earnestly as they
walked along that she did not notice when the scarecrow stumbled into a hole and rolled over to the side of the road indeed he was obliged to call to her to help him up
again why didnt you walk around the hole asked the tin woodman i dont know enough replied the scarecrow cheerfully my head is stuffed with straw you know and that is
why i am going to oz to ask him for some brains oh i see said the tin woodman but after all brains are not the best things in the world have you any inquired the scarecrow
no my head is quite empty answered the woodman but once i had brains and a heart also so having tried them both i should much rather have a heart and why is that asked
the scarecrow i will tell you my story and then you will know so while they were walking through the forest the tin woodman told the following story i was born the son
of a woodman who chopped down trees in the forest and sold the wood for a living when i grew up i too became a woodchopper and after my father died i took care of my old
mother as long as she lived then i made up my mind that instead of living alone i would marry so that i might not become lonely there was one of the munchkin girls who
was so beautiful that i soon grew to love her with all my heart she on her part promised to marry me as soon as i could earn enough money to build a better house for her so
i set to work harder than ever but the girl lived with an old woman who did not want her to marry anyone for she was so lazy she wished the girl to remain with her and do
the cooking and the housework so the old woman went to the wicked witch of the east and promised her two sheep and a cow if she would prevent the marriage thereupon
the wicked witch enchanted my axe and when i was chopping away at my best one day for i was anxious to get the new house and my wife as soon as possible the axe slipped
all at once and cut off my left leg this at first seemed a great misfortune for i knew a one legged man could not do very well as a wood chopper so i went to a tinsmith and
had him make me a new leg out of tin the leg worked very well once i was used to it but my action angered the wicked witch of the east for she had promised the old woman i
should not marry the pretty munchkin girl when i began chopping again my axe slipped and cut off my right leg again i went to the tinsmith and again he made me a leg out
of tin after this the enchanted axe cut off my arms one after the other but nothing daunted i had them replaced with tin ones the wicked witch then made the axe slip
and cut off my head and at first i thought that was the end of me but the tinsmith happened to come along and he made me a new head out of tin i thought i had beaten the
wicked witch then and i worked harder than ever but i little knew how cruel my enemy could be she thought of a new way to kill my love for the beautiful munchkin maiden
and made my axe slip again so that it cut right through my body splitting me into two halves once more the tinsmith came to my help and made me a body of tin fastening my
tin arms and legs and head to it by means of joints so that i could move around as well as ever but alas i had now no heart so that i lost all my love for the munchkin girl
and did not care whether i married her or not i suppose she is still living with the old woman waiting for me to come after her my body shone so brightly in the sun that i
felt very proud of it and it did not matter now if my axe slipped for it could not cut me there was only one danger that my joints would rust but i kept an oil can in my
cottage and took care to oil myself whenever i needed it however there came a day when i forgot to do this and being caught in a rainstorm before i thought of the
danger my joints had rusted and i was left to stand in the woods until you came to help me it was a terrible thing to undergo but during the year i stood there i had time
to think that the greatest loss i had known was the loss of my heart while i was in love i was the happiest man on earth but no one can love who has not a heart and so i am
resolved to ask oz to give me one if he does i will go back to the munchkin maiden and marry her both dorothy and the scarecrow had been greatly interested in the story
of the tin woodman and now they knew why he was so anxious to get a new heart all the same said the scarecrow i shall ask for brains instead of a heart for a fool would not
know what to do with a heart if he had one i shall take the heart returned the tin woodman for brains do not make one happy and happiness is the best thing in the world
dorothy did not say anything for she was puzzled to know which of her two friends was right and she decided if she could only get back to kansas and aunt em it did not
matter so much whether the woodman had no brains and the scarecrow no heart or each got what he wanted what worried her most was that the bread was nearly gone and
another meal for herself and toto would empty the basket to be sure neither the woodman nor the scarecrow ever ate anything but she was not made of tin nor straw and
could not live unless she was fed all this time dorothy and her companions had been walking through the thick woods the road was still paved with yellow brick but
these were much covered by dried branches and dead leaves from the trees and the walking was not at all good there were few birds in this part of the forest for birds
love the open country where there is plenty of sunshine but now and then there came a deep growl from some wild animal hidden among the trees these sounds made the
little girls heart beat fast for she did not know what made them but toto knew and he walked close to dorothys side and did not even bark in return how long will it be
the child asked of the tin woodman before we are out of the forest i cannot tell was the answer for i have never been to the emerald city but my father went there once
when i was a boy and he said it was a long journey through a dangerous country although nearer to the city where oz dwells the country is beautiful but i am not afraid
so long as i have my oil can and nothing can hurt the scarecrow while you bear upon your forehead the mark of the good witchs kiss and that will protect you from harm
but toto said the girl anxiously what will protect him we must protect him ourselves if he is in danger replied the tin woodman just as he spoke there came from the
forest a terrible roar and the next moment a great lion bounded into the road with one blow of his paw he sent the scarecrow spinning over and over to the edge of the
road and then he struck at the tin woodman with his sharp claws but to the lions surprise he could make no impression on the tin although the woodman fell over in the
road and lay still little toto now that he had an enemy to face ran barking toward the lion and the great beast had opened his mouth to bite the dog when dorothy
fearing toto would be killed and heedless of danger rushed forward and slapped the lion upon his nose as hard as she could while she cried out dont you dare to bite
toto you ought to be ashamed of yourself a big beast like you to bite a poor little dog i didnt bite him said the lion as he rubbed his nose with his paw where dorothy had
hit it no but you tried to she retorted you are nothing but a big coward i know it said the lion hanging his head in shame ive always known it but how can i help it i dont
know im sure to think of your striking a stuffed man like the poor scarecrow is he stuffed asked the lion in surprise as he watched her pick up the scarecrow and set
him upon his feet while she patted him into shape again of course hes stuffed replied dorothy who was still angry thats why he went over so easily remarked the lion
it astonished me to see him whirl around so is the other one stuffed also no said dorothy hes made of tin and she helped the woodman up again thats why he nearly
blunted my claws said the lion when they scratched against the tin it made a cold shiver run down my back what is that little animal you are so tender of he is my dog
toto answered dorothy is he made of tin or stuffed asked the lion neither hes a a a meat dog said the girl oh hes a curious animal and seems remarkably small now that i
look at him no one would think of biting such a little thing except a coward like me continued the lion sadly what makes you a coward asked dorothy looking at the
great beast in wonder for he was as big as a small horse its a mystery replied the lion i suppose i was born that way all the other animals in the forest naturally
expect me to be brave for the lion is everywhere thought to be the king of beasts i learned that if i roared very loudly every living thing was frightened and got out
of my way whenever ive met a man ive been awfully scared but i just roared at him and he has always run away as fast as he could go if the elephants and the tigers and the
bears had ever tried to fight me i should have run myself im such a coward but just as soon as they hear me roar they all try to get away from me and of course i let them go
but that isnt right the king of beasts shouldnt be a coward said the scarecrow i know it returned the lion wiping a tear from his eye with the tip of his tail it is my
great sorrow and makes my life very unhappy but whenever there is danger my heart begins to beat fast perhaps you have heart disease said the tin woodman it may be
said the lion if you have continued the tin woodman you ought to be glad for it proves you have a heart for my part i have no heart so i cannot have heart disease perhaps
said the lion thoughtfully if i had no heart i should not be a coward have you brains asked the scarecrow i suppose so ive never looked to see replied the lion i am
going to the great oz to ask him to give me some remarked the scarecrow for my head is stuffed with straw and i am going to ask him to give me a heart said the woodman and i
am going to ask him to send toto and me back to kansas added dorothy do you think oz could give me courage asked the cowardly lion just as easily as he could give me
brains said the scarecrow or give me a heart said the tin woodman or send me back to kansas said dorothy then if you dont mind ill go with you said the lion for my life is
simply unbearable without a bit of courage you will be very welcome answered dorothy for you will help to keep away the other wild beasts it seems to me they must be
more cowardly than you are if they allow you to scare them so easily they really are said the lion but that doesnt make me any braver and as long as i know myself to be a
coward i shall be unhappy so once more the little company set off upon the journey the lion walking with stately strides at dorothys side toto did not approve of
this new comrade at first for he could not forget how nearly he had been crushed between the lions great jaws but after a time he became more at ease and presently
toto and the cowardly lion had grown to be good friends during the rest of that day there was no other adventure to mar the peace of their journey once indeed the tin
woodman stepped upon a beetle that was crawling along the road and killed the poor little thing this made the tin woodman very unhappy for he was always careful not
to hurt any living creature and as he walked along he wept several tears of sorrow and regret these tears ran slowly down his face and over the hinges of his jaw and
there they rusted when dorothy presently asked him a question the tin woodman could not open his mouth for his jaws were tightly rusted together he became greatly
frightened at this and made many motions to dorothy to relieve him but she could not understand the lion was also puzzled to know what was wrong but the scarecrow
seized the oil can from dorothys basket and oiled the woodmans jaws so that after a few moments he could talk as well as before this will serve me a lesson said he to
look where i step for if i should kill another bug or beetle i should surely cry again and crying rusts my jaws so that i cannot speak thereafter he walked very
carefully with his eyes on the road and when he saw a tiny ant toiling by he would step over it so as not to harm it the tin woodman knew very well he had no heart and
therefore he took great care never to be cruel or unkind to anything you people with hearts he said have something to guide you and need never do wrong but i have no
heart and so i must be very careful when oz gives me a heart of course i neednt mind so much they were obliged to camp out that night under a large tree in the forest for
there were no houses near the tree made a good thick covering to protect them from the dew and the tin woodman chopped a great pile of wood with his axe and dorothy
built a splendid fire that warmed her and made her feel less lonely she and toto ate the last of their bread and now she did not know what they would do for breakfast if
you wish said the lion i will go into the forest and kill a deer for you you can roast it by the fire since your tastes are so peculiar that you prefer cooked food and
then you will have a very good breakfast dont please dont begged the tin woodman i should certainly weep if you killed a poor deer and then my jaws would rust again
but the lion went away into the forest and found his own supper and no one ever knew what it was for he didnt mention it and the scarecrow found a tree full of nuts and
filled dorothys basket with them so that she would not be hungry for a long time she thought this was very kind and thoughtful of the scarecrow but she laughed
heartily at the awkward way in which the poor creature picked up the nuts his padded hands were so clumsy and the nuts were so small that he dropped almost as many as
he put in the basket but the scarecrow did not mind how long it took him to fill the basket for it enabled him to keep away from the fire as he feared a spark might get
into his straw and burn him up so he kept a good distance away from the flames and only came near to cover dorothy with dry leaves when she lay down to sleep these kept
her very snug and warm and she slept soundly until morning when it was daylight the girl bathed her face in a little rippling brook and soon after they all started
toward the emerald city this was to be an eventful day for the travelers they had hardly been walking an hour when they saw before them a great ditch that crossed the
road and divided the forest as far as they could see on either side it was a very wide ditch and when they crept up to the edge and looked into it they could see it was
also very deep and there were many big jagged rocks at the bottom the sides were so steep that none of them could climb down and for a moment it seemed that their
journey must end what shall we do asked dorothy despairingly i havent the faintest idea said the tin woodman and the lion shook his shaggy mane and looked
thoughtful but the scarecrow said we cannot fly that is certain neither can we climb down into this great ditch therefore if we cannot jump over it we must stop
where we are i think i could jump over it said the cowardly lion after measuring the distance carefully in his mind then we are all right answered the scarecrow for
you can carry us all over on your back one at a time well ill try it said the lion who will go first i will declared the scarecrow for if you found that you could not jump
over the gulf dorothy would be killed or the tin woodman badly dented on the rocks below but if i am on your back it will not matter so much for the fall would not hurt me
at all i am terribly afraid of falling myself said the cowardly lion but i suppose there is nothing to do but try it so get on my back and we will make the attempt the
scarecrow sat upon the lions back and the big beast walked to the edge of the gulf and crouched down why dont you run and jump asked the scarecrow because that isnt
the way we lions do these things he replied then giving a great spring he shot through the air and landed safely on the other side they were all greatly pleased to see
how easily he did it and after the scarecrow had got down from his back the lion sprang across the ditch again dorothy thought she would go next so she took toto in her
arms and climbed on the lions back holding tightly to his mane with one hand the next moment it seemed as if she were flying through the air and then before she had
time to think about it she was safe on the other side the lion went back a third time and got the tin woodman and then they all sat down for a few moments to give the beast
a chance to rest for his great leaps had made his breath short and he panted like a big dog that has been running too long they found the forest very thick on this side
and it looked dark and gloomy after the lion had rested they started along the road of yellow brick silently wondering each in his own mind if ever they would come to
the end of the woods and reach the bright sunshine again to add to their discomfort they soon heard strange noises in the depths of the forest and the lion whispered
to them that it was in this part of the country that the kalidahs lived what are the kalidahs asked the girl they are monstrous beasts with bodies like bears and
heads like tigers replied the lion and with claws so long and sharp that they could tear me in two as easily as i could kill toto im terribly afraid of the kalidahs im
not surprised that you are returned dorothy they must be dreadful beasts the lion was about to reply when suddenly they came to another gulf across the road but
this one was so broad and deep that the lion knew at once he could not leap across it so they sat down to consider what they should do and after serious thought the
scarecrow said here is a great tree standing close to the ditch if the tin woodman can chop it down so that it will fall to the other side we can walk across it easily
that is a first rate idea said the lion one would almost suspect you had brains in your head instead of straw the woodman set to work at once and so sharp was his axe
that the tree was soon chopped nearly through then the lion put his strong front legs against the tree and pushed with all his might and slowly the big tree tipped
and fell with a crash across the ditch with its top branches on the other side they had just started to cross this queer bridge when a sharp growl made them all look up
and to their horror they saw running toward them two great beasts with bodies like bears and heads like tigers they are the kalidahs said the cowardly lion
beginning to tremble quick cried the scarecrow let us cross over so dorothy went first holding toto in her arms the tin woodman followed and the scarecrow came
next the lion although he was certainly afraid turned to face the kalidahs and then he gave so loud and terrible a roar that dorothy screamed and the scarecrow fell
over backward while even the fierce beasts stopped short and looked at him in surprise but seeing they were bigger than the lion and remembering that there were
two of them and only one of him the kalidahs again rushed forward and the lion crossed over the tree and turned to see what they would do next without stopping an
instant the fierce beasts also began to cross the tree and the lion said to dorothy we are lost for they will surely tear us to pieces with their sharp claws but stand
close behind me and i will fight them as long as i am alive wait a minute called the scarecrow he had been thinking what was best to be done and now he asked the woodman
to chop away the end of the tree that rested on their side of the ditch the tin woodman began to use his axe at once and just as the two kalidahs were nearly across the
tree fell with a crash into the gulf carrying the ugly snarling brutes with it and both were dashed to pieces on the sharp rocks at the bottom well said the cowardly
lion drawing a long breath of relief i see we are going to live a little while longer and i am glad of it for it must be a very uncomfortable thing not to be alive those
creatures frightened me so badly that my heart is beating yet ah said the tin woodman sadly i wish i had a heart to beat this adventure made the travelers more
anxious than ever to get out of the forest and they walked so fast that dorothy became tired and had to ride on the lions back to their great joy the trees became
thinner the farther they advanced and in the afternoon they suddenly came upon a broad river flowing swiftly just before them on the other side of the water they
could see the road of yellow brick running through a beautiful country with green meadows dotted with bright flowers and all the road bordered with trees hanging
full of delicious fruits they were greatly pleased to see this delightful country before them how shall we cross the river asked dorothy that is easily done
replied the scarecrow the tin woodman must build us a raft so we can float to the other side so the woodman took his axe and began to chop down small trees to make a raft
and while he was busy at this the scarecrow found on the riverbank a tree full of fine fruit this pleased dorothy who had eaten nothing but nuts all day and she made a
hearty meal of the ripe fruit but it takes time to make a raft even when one is as industrious and untiring as the tin woodman and when night came the work was not done
so they found a cozy place under the trees where they slept well until the morning and dorothy dreamed of the emerald city and of the good wizard oz who would soon
send her back to her own home again our little party of travelers awakened the next morning refreshed and full of hope and dorothy breakfasted like a princess off
peaches and plums from the trees beside the river behind them was the dark forest they had passed safely through although they had suffered many discouragements
but before them was a lovely sunny country that seemed to beckon them on to the emerald city to be sure the broad river now cut them off from this beautiful land but
the raft was nearly done and after the tin woodman had cut a few more logs and fastened them together with wooden pins they were ready to start dorothy sat down in the
middle of the raft and held toto in her arms when the cowardly lion stepped upon the raft it tipped badly for he was big and heavy but the scarecrow and the tin woodman
stood upon the other end to steady it and they had long poles in their hands to push the raft through the water they got along quite well at first but when they reached
the middle of the river the swift current swept the raft downstream farther and farther away from the road of yellow brick and the water grew so deep that the long
poles would not touch the bottom this is bad said the tin woodman for if we cannot get to the land we shall be carried into the country of the wicked witch of the west
and she will enchant us and make us her slaves and then i should get no brains said the scarecrow and i should get no courage said the cowardly lion and i should get no
heart said the tin woodman and i should never get back to kansas said dorothy we must certainly get to the emerald city if we can the scarecrow continued and he
pushed so hard on his long pole that it stuck fast in the mud at the bottom of the river then before he could pull it out again or let go the raft was swept away and the
poor scarecrow was left clinging to the pole in the middle of the river good bye he called after them and they were very sorry to leave him indeed the tin woodman
began to cry but fortunately remembered that he might rust and so dried his tears on dorothys apron of course this was a bad thing for the scarecrow i am now worse off
than when i first met dorothy he thought then i was stuck on a pole in a cornfield where i could make believe scare the crows at any rate but surely there is no use for a
scarecrow stuck on a pole in the middle of a river i am afraid i shall never have any brains after all down the stream the raft floated and the poor scarecrow was left
far behind then the lion said something must be done to save us i think i can swim to the shore and pull the raft after me if you will only hold fast to the tip of my tail so
he sprang into the water and the tin woodman caught fast hold of his tail then the lion began to swim with all his might toward the shore it was hard work although he
was so big but by and by they were drawn out of the current and then dorothy took the tin woodmans long pole and helped push the raft to the land they were all tired out
when they reached the shore at last and stepped off upon the pretty green grass and they also knew that the stream had carried them a long way past the road of yellow
brick that led to the emerald city what shall we do now asked the tin woodman as the lion lay down on the grass to let the sun dry him we must get back to the road in some
way said dorothy the best plan will be to walk along the riverbank until we come to the road again remarked the lion so when they were rested dorothy picked up her
basket and they started along the grassy bank to the road from which the river had carried them it was a lovely country with plenty of flowers and fruit trees and
sunshine to cheer them and had they not felt so sorry for the poor scarecrow they could have been very happy they walked along as fast as they could dorothy only
stopping once to pick a beautiful flower and after a time the tin woodman cried out look then they all looked at the river and saw the scarecrow perched upon his pole
in the middle of the water looking very lonely and sad what can we do to save him asked dorothy the lion and the woodman both shook their heads for they did not know so
they sat down upon the bank and gazed wistfully at the scarecrow until a stork flew by who upon seeing them stopped to rest at the waters edge who are you and where are
you going asked the stork i am dorothy answered the girl and these are my friends the tin woodman and the cowardly lion and we are going to the emerald city this isnt
the road said the stork as she twisted her long neck and looked sharply at the queer party i know it returned dorothy but we have lost the scarecrow and are wondering
how we shall get him again where is he asked the stork over there in the river answered the little girl if he wasnt so big and heavy i would get him for you remarked the
stork he isnt heavy a bit said dorothy eagerly for he is stuffed with straw and if you will bring him back to us we shall thank you ever and ever so much well ill try said
the stork but if i find he is too heavy to carry i shall have to drop him in the river again so the big bird flew into the air and over the water till she came to where the
scarecrow was perched upon his pole then the stork with her great claws grabbed the scarecrow by the arm and carried him up into the air and back to the bank where
dorothy and the lion and the tin woodman and toto were sitting when the scarecrow found himself among his friends again he was so happy that he hugged them all even
the lion and toto and as they walked along he sang tol de ri de oh at every step he felt so gay i was afraid i should have to stay in the river forever he said but the kind
stork saved me and if i ever get any brains i shall find the stork again and do her some kindness in return thats all right said the stork who was flying along beside
them i always like to help anyone in trouble but i must go now for my babies are waiting in the nest for me i hope you will find the emerald city and that oz will help you
thank you replied dorothy and then the kind stork flew into the air and was soon out of sight they walked along listening to the singing of the brightly colored
birds and looking at the lovely flowers which now became so thick that the ground was carpeted with them there were big yellow and white and blue and purple
blossoms besides great clusters of scarlet poppies which were so brilliant in color they almost dazzled dorothys eyes arent they beautiful the girl asked as she
breathed in the spicy scent of the bright flowers i suppose so answered the scarecrow when i have brains i shall probably like them better if i only had a heart i
should love them added the tin woodman i always did like flowers said the lion they seem so helpless and frail but there are none in the forest so bright as these they
now came upon more and more of the big scarlet poppies and fewer and fewer of the other flowers and soon they found themselves in the midst of a great meadow of
poppies now it is well known that when there are many of these flowers together their odor is so powerful that anyone who breathes it falls asleep and if the sleeper
is not carried away from the scent of the flowers he sleeps on and on forever but dorothy did not know this nor could she get away from the bright red flowers that were
everywhere about so presently her eyes grew heavy and she felt she must sit down to rest and to sleep but the tin woodman would not let her do this we must hurry and get
back to the road of yellow brick before dark he said and the scarecrow agreed with him so they kept walking until dorothy could stand no longer her eyes closed in
spite of herself and she forgot where she was and fell among the poppies fast asleep what shall we do asked the tin woodman if we leave her here she will die said the
lion the smell of the flowers is killing us all i myself can scarcely keep my eyes open and the dog is asleep already it was true toto had fallen down beside his little
mistress but the scarecrow and the tin woodman not being made of flesh were not troubled by the scent of the flowers run fast said the scarecrow to the lion and get
out of this deadly flower bed as soon as you can we will bring the little girl with us but if you should fall asleep you are too big to be carried so the lion aroused
himself and bounded forward as fast as he could go in a moment he was out of sight let us make a chair with our hands and carry her said the scarecrow so they picked up
toto and put the dog in dorothys lap and then they made a chair with their hands for the seat and their arms for the arms and carried the sleeping girl between them
through the flowers on and on they walked and it seemed that the great carpet of deadly flowers that surrounded them would never end they followed the bend of the
river and at last came upon their friend the lion lying fast asleep among the poppies the flowers had been too strong for the huge beast and he had given up at last and
fallen only a short distance from the end of the poppy bed where the sweet grass spread in beautiful green fields before them we can do nothing for him said the tin
woodman sadly for he is much too heavy to lift we must leave him here to sleep on forever and perhaps he will dream that he has found courage at last im sorry said the
scarecrow the lion was a very good comrade for one so cowardly but let us go on they carried the sleeping girl to a pretty spot beside the river far enough from the
poppy field to prevent her breathing any more of the poison of the flowers and here they laid her gently on the soft grass and waited for the fresh breeze to waken her
we cannot be far from the road of yellow brick now remarked the scarecrow as he stood beside the girl for we have come nearly as far as the river carried us away the tin
woodman was about to reply when he heard a low growl and turning his head which worked beautifully on hinges he saw a strange beast come bounding over the grass
toward them it was indeed a great yellow wildcat and the woodman thought it must be chasing something for its ears were lying close to its head and its mouth was wide
open showing two rows of ugly teeth while its red eyes glowed like balls of fire as it came nearer the tin woodman saw that running before the beast was a little gray
field mouse and although he had no heart he knew it was wrong for the wildcat to try to kill such a pretty harmless creature so the woodman raised his axe and as the
wildcat ran by he gave it a quick blow that cut the beasts head clean off from its body and it rolled over at his feet in two pieces the field mouse now that it was freed
from its enemy stopped short and coming slowly up to the woodman it said in a squeaky little voice oh thank you thank you ever so much for saving my life dont speak of
it i beg of you replied the woodman i have no heart you know so i am careful to help all those who may need a friend even if it happens to be only a mouse only a mouse cried
the little animal indignantly why i am a queen the queen of all the field mice oh indeed said the woodman making a bow therefore you have done a great deed as well as a
brave one in saving my life added the queen at that moment several mice were seen running up as fast as their little legs could carry them and when they saw their
queen they exclaimed oh your majesty we thought you would be killed how did you manage to escape the great wildcat they all bowed so low to the little queen that they
almost stood upon their heads this funny tin man she answered killed the wildcat and saved my life so hereafter you must all serve him and obey his slightest wish we
will cried all the mice in a shrill chorus and then they scampered in all directions for toto had awakened from his sleep and seeing all these mice around him he gave
one bark of delight and jumped right into the middle of the group toto had always loved to chase mice when he lived in kansas and he saw no harm in it but the tin woodman
caught the dog in his arms and held him tight while he called to the mice come back come back toto shall not hurt you at this the queen of the mice stuck her head out from
underneath a clump of grass and asked in a timid voice are you sure he will not bite us i will not let him said the woodman so do not be afraid one by one the mice came
creeping back and toto did not bark again although he tried to get out of the woodmans arms and would have bitten him had he not known very well he was made of tin
finally one of the biggest mice spoke is there anything we can do it asked to repay you for saving the life of our queen nothing that i know of answered the woodman but
the scarecrow who had been trying to think but could not because his head was stuffed with straw said quickly oh yes you can save our friend the cowardly lion who is
asleep in the poppy bed a lion cried the little queen why he would eat us all up oh no declared the scarecrow this lion is a coward really asked the mouse he says so
himself answered the scarecrow and he would never hurt anyone who is our friend if you will help us to save him i promise that he shall treat you all with kindness
very well said the queen we trust you but what shall we do are there many of these mice which call you queen and are willing to obey you oh yes there are thousands she
replied then send for them all to come here as soon as possible and let each one bring a long piece of string the queen turned to the mice that attended her and told
them to go at once and get all her people as soon as they heard her orders they ran away in every direction as fast as possible now said the scarecrow to the tin woodman
you must go to those trees by the riverside and make a truck that will carry the lion so the woodman went at once to the trees and began to work and he soon made a truck
out of the limbs of trees from which he chopped away all the leaves and branches he fastened it together with wooden pegs and made the four wheels out of short pieces
of a big tree trunk so fast and so well did he work that by the time the mice began to arrive the truck was all ready for them they came from all directions and there were
thousands of them big mice and little mice and middle sized mice and each one brought a piece of string in his mouth it was about this time that dorothy woke from her
long sleep and opened her eyes she was greatly astonished to find herself lying upon the grass with thousands of mice standing around and looking at her timidly
but the scarecrow told her about everything and turning to the dignified little mouse he said permit me to introduce to you her majesty the queen dorothy nodded
gravely and the queen made a curtsy after which she became quite friendly with the little girl the scarecrow and the woodman now began to fasten the mice to the
truck using the strings they had brought one end of a string was tied around the neck of each mouse and the other end to the truck of course the truck was a thousand
times bigger than any of the mice who were to draw it but when all the mice had been harnessed they were able to pull it quite easily even the scarecrow and the tin
woodman could sit on it and were drawn swiftly by their queer little horses to the place where the lion lay asleep after a great deal of hard work for the lion was
heavy they managed to get him up on the truck then the queen hurriedly gave her people the order to start for she feared if the mice stayed among the poppies too long
they also would fall asleep at first the little creatures many though they were could hardly stir the heavily loaded truck but the woodman and the scarecrow both
pushed from behind and they got along better soon they rolled the lion out of the poppy bed to the green fields where he could breathe the sweet fresh air again
instead of the poisonous scent of the flowers dorothy came to meet them and thanked the little mice warmly for saving her companion from death she had grown so fond
of the big lion she was glad he had been rescued then the mice were unharnessed from the truck and scampered away through the grass to their homes the queen of the
mice was the last to leave if ever you need us again she said come out into the field and call and we shall hear you and come to your assistance good bye good bye they all
answered and away the queen ran while dorothy held toto tightly lest he should run after her and frighten her after this they sat down beside the lion until he
should awaken and the scarecrow brought dorothy some fruit from a tree near by which she ate for her dinner it was some time before the cowardly lion awakened for he
had lain among the poppies a long while breathing in their deadly fragrance but when he did open his eyes and roll off the truck he was very glad to find himself still
alive i ran as fast as i could he said sitting down and yawning but the flowers were too strong for me how did you get me out then they told him of the field mice and how
they had generously saved him from death and the cowardly lion laughed and said i have always thought myself very big and terrible yet such little things as
flowers came near to killing me and such small animals as mice have saved my life how strange it all is but comrades what shall we do now we must journey on until we
find the road of yellow brick again said dorothy and then we can keep on to the emerald city so the lion being fully refreshed and feeling quite himself again they
all started upon the journey greatly enjoying the walk through the soft fresh grass and it was not long before they reached the road of yellow brick and turned
again toward the emerald city where the great oz dwelt the road was smooth and well paved now and the country about was beautiful so that the travelers rejoiced in
leaving the forest far behind and with it the many dangers they had met in its gloomy shades once more they could see fences built beside the road but these were
painted green and when they came to a small house in which a farmer evidently lived that also was painted green they passed by several of these houses during the
afternoon and sometimes people came to the doors and looked at them as if they would like to ask questions but no one came near them nor spoke to them because of the
great lion of which they were very much afraid the people were all dressed in clothing of a lovely emerald green color and wore peaked hats like those of the
munchkins this must be the land of oz said dorothy and we are surely getting near the emerald city yes answered the scarecrow everything is green here while in the
country of the munchkins blue was the favorite color but the people do not seem to be as friendly as the munchkins and im afraid we shall be unable to find a place to
pass the night i should like something to eat besides fruit said the girl and im sure toto is nearly starved let us stop at the next house and talk to the people so when
they came to a good sized farmhouse dorothy walked boldly up to the door and knocked a woman opened it just far enough to look out and said what do you want child and
why is that great lion with you we wish to pass the night with you if you will allow us answered dorothy and the lion is my friend and comrade and would not hurt you for
the world is he tame asked the woman opening the door a little wider oh yes said the girl and he is a great coward too he will be more afraid of you than you are of him well
said the woman after thinking it over and taking another peep at the lion if that is the case you may come in and i will give you some supper and a place to sleep so they
all entered the house where there were besides the woman two children and a man the man had hurt his leg and was lying on the couch in a corner they seemed greatly
surprised to see so strange a company and while the woman was busy laying the table the man asked where are you all going to the emerald city said dorothy to see the
great oz oh indeed exclaimed the man are you sure that oz will see you why not she replied why it is said that he never lets anyone come into his presence i have been to
the emerald city many times and it is a beautiful and wonderful place but i have never been permitted to see the great oz nor do i know of any living person who has seen
him does he never go out asked the scarecrow never he sits day after day in the great throne room of his palace and even those who wait upon him do not see him face to
face what is he like asked the girl that is hard to tell said the man thoughtfully you see oz is a great wizard and can take on any form he wishes so that some say he looks
like a bird and some say he looks like an elephant and some say he looks like a cat to others he appears as a beautiful fairy or a brownie or in any other form that
pleases him but who the real oz is when he is in his own form no living person can tell that is very strange said dorothy but we must try in some way to see him or we shall
have made our journey for nothing why do you wish to see the terrible oz asked the man i want him to give me some brains said the scarecrow eagerly oh oz could do that
easily enough declared the man he has more brains than he needs and i want him to give me a heart said the tin woodman that will not trouble him continued the man for oz
has a large collection of hearts of all sizes and shapes and i want him to give me courage said the cowardly lion oz keeps a great pot of courage in his throne room said
the man which he has covered with a golden plate to keep it from running over he will be glad to give you some and i want him to send me back to kansas said dorothy where
is kansas asked the man with surprise i dont know replied dorothy sorrowfully but it is my home and im sure its somewhere very likely well oz can do anything so i
suppose he will find kansas for you but first you must get to see him and that will be a hard task for the great wizard does not like to see anyone and he usually has his
own way but what do you want he continued speaking to toto toto only wagged his tail for strange to say he could not speak the woman now called to them that supper was
ready so they gathered around the table and dorothy ate some delicious porridge and a dish of scrambled eggs and a plate of nice white bread and enjoyed her meal the
lion ate some of the porridge but did not care for it saying it was made from oats and oats were food for horses not for lions the scarecrow and the tin woodman ate
nothing at all toto ate a little of everything and was glad to get a good supper again the woman now gave dorothy a bed to sleep in and toto lay down beside her while the
lion guarded the door of her room so she might not be disturbed the scarecrow and the tin woodman stood up in a corner and kept quiet all night although of course they
could not sleep the next morning as soon as the sun was up they started on their way and soon saw a beautiful green glow in the sky just before them that must be the
emerald city said dorothy as they walked on the green glow became brighter and brighter and it seemed that at last they were nearing the end of their travels yet it
was afternoon before they came to the great wall that surrounded the city it was high and thick and of a bright green color in front of them and at the end of the road of
yellow brick was a big gate all studded with emeralds that glittered so in the sun that even the painted eyes of the scarecrow were dazzled by their brilliancy
there was a bell beside the gate and dorothy pushed the button and heard a silvery tinkle sound within then the big gate swung slowly open and they all passed
through and found themselves in a high arched room the walls of which glistened with countless emeralds before them stood a little man about the same size as the
munchkins he was clothed all in green from his head to his feet and even his skin was of a greenish tint at his side was a large green box when he saw dorothy and her
companions the man asked what do you wish in the emerald city we came here to see the great oz said dorothy the man was so surprised at this answer that he sat down to
think it over it has been many years since anyone asked me to see oz he said shaking his head in perplexity he is powerful and terrible and if you come on an idle or
foolish errand to bother the wise reflections of the great wizard he might be angry and destroy you all in an instant but it is not a foolish errand nor an idle one
replied the scarecrow it is important and we have been told that oz is a good wizard so he is said the green man and he rules the emerald city wisely and well but to
those who are not honest or who approach him from curiosity he is most terrible and few have ever dared ask to see his face i am the guardian of the gates and since you
demand to see the great oz i must take you to his palace but first you must put on the spectacles why asked dorothy because if you did not wear spectacles the
brightness and glory of the emerald city would blind you even those who live in the city must wear spectacles night and day they are all locked on for oz so ordered it
when the city was first built and i have the only key that will unlock them he opened the big box and dorothy saw that it was filled with spectacles of every size and
shape all of them had green glasses in them the guardian of the gates found a pair that would just fit dorothy and put them over her eyes there were two golden bands
fastened to them that passed around the back of her head where they were locked together by a little key that was at the end of a chain the guardian of the gates wore
around his neck when they were on dorothy could not take them off had she wished but of course she did not wish to be blinded by the glare of the emerald city so she said
nothing then the green man fitted spectacles for the scarecrow and the tin woodman and the lion and even on little toto and all were locked fast with the key then the
guardian of the gates put on his own glasses and told them he was ready to show them to the palace taking a big golden key from a peg on the wall he opened another gate
and they all followed him through the portal into the streets of the emerald city even with eyes protected by the green spectacles dorothy and her friends were at
first dazzled by the brilliancy of the wonderful city the streets were lined with beautiful houses all built of green marble and studded everywhere with
sparkling emeralds they walked over a pavement of the same green marble and where the blocks were joined together were rows of emeralds set closely and
glittering in the brightness of the sun the window panes were of green glass even the sky above the city had a green tint and the rays of the sun were green there were
many people men women and children walking about and these were all dressed in green clothes and had greenish skins they looked at dorothy and her strangely
assorted company with wondering eyes and the children all ran away and hid behind their mothers when they saw the lion but no one spoke to them many shops stood in
the street and dorothy saw that everything in them was green green candy and green pop corn were offered for sale as well as green shoes green hats and green clothes
of all sorts at one place a man was selling green lemonade and when the children bought it dorothy could see that they paid for it with green pennies there seemed to
be no horses nor animals of any kind the men carried things around in little green carts which they pushed before them everyone seemed happy and contented and
prosperous the guardian of the gates led them through the streets until they came to a big building exactly in the middle of the city which was the palace of oz the
great wizard there was a soldier before the door dressed in a green uniform and wearing a long green beard here are strangers said the guardian of the gates to him
and they demand to see the great oz step inside answered the soldier and i will carry your message to him so they passed through the palace gates and were led into a
big room with a green carpet and lovely green furniture set with emeralds the soldier made them all wipe their feet upon a green mat before entering this room and
when they were seated he said politely please make yourselves comfortable while i go to the door of the throne room and tell oz you are here they had to wait a long
time before the soldier returned when at last he came back dorothy asked have you seen oz oh no returned the soldier i have never seen him but i spoke to him as he sat
behind his screen and gave him your message he said he will grant you an audience if you so desire but each one of you must enter his presence alone and he will admit
but one each day therefore as you must remain in the palace for several days i will have you shown to rooms where you may rest in comfort after your journey thank you
replied the girl that is very kind of oz the soldier now blew upon a green whistle and at once a young girl dressed in a pretty green silk gown entered the room she had
lovely green hair and green eyes and she bowed low before dorothy as she said follow me and i will show you your room so dorothy said good bye to all her friends except
toto and taking the dog in her arms followed the green girl through seven passages and up three flights of stairs until they came to a room at the front of the palace
it was the sweetest little room in the world with a soft comfortable bed that had sheets of green silk and a green velvet counterpane there was a tiny fountain in the
middle of the room that shot a spray of green perfume into the air to fall back into a beautifully carved green marble basin beautiful green flowers stood in the
windows and there was a shelf with a row of little green books when dorothy had time to open these books she found them full of queer green pictures that made her
laugh they were so funny in a wardrobe were many green dresses made of silk and satin and velvet and all of them fitted dorothy exactly make yourself perfectly at
home said the green girl and if you wish for anything ring the bell oz will send for you tomorrow morning she left dorothy alone and went back to the others these she
also led to rooms and each one of them found himself lodged in a very pleasant part of the palace of course this politeness was wasted on the scarecrow for when he
found himself alone in his room he stood stupidly in one spot just within the doorway to wait till morning it would not rest him to lie down and he could not close his
eyes so he remained all night staring at a little spider which was weaving its web in a corner of the room just as if it were not one of the most wonderful rooms in the
world the tin woodman lay down on his bed from force of habit for he remembered when he was made of flesh but not being able to sleep he passed the night moving his
joints up and down to make sure they kept in good working order the lion would have preferred a bed of dried leaves in the forest and did not like being shut up in a room
but he had too much sense to let this worry him so he sprang upon the bed and rolled himself up like a cat and purred himself asleep in a minute the next morning after
breakfast the green maiden came to fetch dorothy and she dressed her in one of the prettiest gowns made of green brocaded satin dorothy put on a green silk apron and
tied a green ribbon around totos neck and they started for the throne room of the great oz first they came to a great hall in which were many ladies and gentlemen of
the court all dressed in rich costumes these people had nothing to do but talk to each other but they always came to wait outside the throne room every morning
although they were never permitted to see oz as dorothy entered they looked at her curiously and one of them whispered are you really going to look upon the face of
oz the terrible of course answered the girl if he will see me oh he will see you said the soldier who had taken her message to the wizard although he does not like to
have people ask to see him indeed at first he was angry and said i should send you back where you came from then he asked me what you looked like and when i mentioned
your silver shoes he was very much interested at last i told him about the mark upon your forehead and he decided he would admit you to his presence just then a bell
rang and the green girl said to dorothy that is the signal you must go into the throne room alone she opened a little door and dorothy walked boldly through and found
herself in a wonderful place it was a big round room with a high arched roof and the walls and ceiling and floor were covered with large emeralds set closely
together in the center of the roof was a great light as bright as the sun which made the emeralds sparkle in a wonderful manner but what interested dorothy most was
the big throne of green marble that stood in the middle of the room it was shaped like a chair and sparkled with gems as did everything else in the center of the chair
was an enormous head without a body to support it or any arms or legs whatever there was no hair upon this head but it had eyes and a nose and mouth and was much bigger
than the head of the biggest giant as dorothy gazed upon this in wonder and fear the eyes turned slowly and looked at her sharply and steadily then the mouth moved
and dorothy heard a voice say i am oz the great and terrible who are you and why do you seek me it was not such an awful voice as she had expected to come from the big head
so she took courage and answered i am dorothy the small and meek i have come to you for help the eyes looked at her thoughtfully for a full minute then said the voice
where did you get the silver shoes i got them from the wicked witch of the east when my house fell on her and killed her she replied where did you get the mark upon your
forehead continued the voice that is where the good witch of the north kissed me when she bade me good bye and sent me to you said the girl again the eyes looked at her
sharply and they saw she was telling the truth then oz asked what do you wish me to do send me back to kansas where my aunt em and uncle henry are she answered earnestly
i dont like your country although it is so beautiful and i am sure aunt em will be dreadfully worried over my being away so long the eyes winked three times and then
they turned up to the ceiling and down to the floor and rolled around so queerly that they seemed to see every part of the room and at last they looked at dorothy again
why should i do this for you asked oz because you are strong and i am weak because you are a great wizard and i am only a little girl but you were strong enough to kill the
wicked witch of the east said oz that just happened returned dorothy simply i could not help it well said the head i will give you my answer you have no right to expect
me to send you back to kansas unless you do something for me in return in this country everyone must pay for everything he gets if you wish me to use my magic power to
send you home again you must do something for me first help me and i will help you what must i do asked the girl kill the wicked witch of the west answered oz but i cannot
exclaimed dorothy greatly surprised you killed the witch of the east and you wear the silver shoes which bear a powerful charm there is now but one wicked witch
left in all this land and when you can tell me she is dead i will send you back to kansas but not before the little girl began to weep she was so much disappointed and the
eyes winked again and looked upon her anxiously as if the great oz felt that she could help him if she would i never killed anything willingly she sobbed even if i
wanted to how could i kill the wicked witch if you who are great and terrible cannot kill her yourself how do you expect me to do it i do not know said the head but that is
my answer and until the wicked witch dies you will not see your uncle and aunt again remember that the witch is wicked tremendously wicked and ought to be killed now
go and do not ask to see me again until you have done your task sorrowfully dorothy left the throne room and went back where the lion and the scarecrow and the tin
woodman were waiting to hear what oz had said to her there is no hope for me she said sadly for oz will not send me home until i have killed the wicked witch of the west
and that i can never do her friends were sorry but could do nothing to help her so dorothy went to her own room and lay down on the bed and cried herself to sleep the next
morning the soldier with the green whiskers came to the scarecrow and said come with me for oz has sent for you so the scarecrow followed him and was admitted into
the great throne room where he saw sitting in the emerald throne a most lovely lady she was dressed in green silk gauze and wore upon her flowing green locks a crown
of jewels growing from her shoulders were wings gorgeous in color and so light that they fluttered if the slightest breath of air reached them when the scarecrow
had bowed as prettily as his straw stuffing would let him before this beautiful creature she looked upon him sweetly and said i am oz the great and terrible who are
you and why do you seek me now the scarecrow who had expected to see the great head dorothy had told him of was much astonished but he answered her bravely i am only a
scarecrow stuffed with straw therefore i have no brains and i come to you praying that you will put brains in my head instead of straw so that i may become as much a man
as any other in your dominions why should i do this for you asked the lady because you are wise and powerful and no one else can help me answered the scarecrow i never
grant favors without some return said oz but this much i will promise if you will kill for me the wicked witch of the west i will bestow upon you a great many brains and
such good brains that you will be the wisest man in all the land of oz i thought you asked dorothy to kill the witch said the scarecrow in surprise so i did i dont care
who kills her but until she is dead i will not grant your wish now go and do not seek me again until you have earned the brains you so greatly desire the scarecrow went
sorrowfully back to his friends and told them what oz had said and dorothy was surprised to find that the great wizard was not a head as she had seen him but a lovely
lady all the same said the scarecrow she needs a heart as much as the tin woodman on the next morning the soldier with the green whiskers came to the tin woodman and
said oz has sent for you follow me so the tin woodman followed him and came to the great throne room he did not know whether he would find oz a lovely lady or a head but he
hoped it would be the lovely lady for he said to himself if it is the head i am sure i shall not be given a heart since a head has no heart of its own and therefore cannot
feel for me but if it is the lovely lady i shall beg hard for a heart for all ladies are themselves said to be kindly hearted but when the woodman entered the great
throne room he saw neither the head nor the lady for oz had taken the shape of a most terrible beast it was nearly as big as an elephant and the green throne seemed
hardly strong enough to hold its weight the beast had a head like that of a rhinoceros only there were five eyes in its face there were five long arms growing out of
its body and it also had five long slim legs thick woolly hair covered every part of it and a more dreadful looking monster could not be imagined it was fortunate the
tin woodman had no heart at that moment for it would have beat loud and fast from terror but being only tin the woodman was not at all afraid although he was much
disappointed i am oz the great and terrible spoke the beast in a voice that was one great roar who are you and why do you seek me i am a woodman and made of tin therefore i
have no heart and cannot love i pray you to give me a heart that i may be as other men are why should i do this demanded the beast because i ask it and you alone can grant my
request answered the woodman oz gave a low growl at this but said gruffly if you indeed desire a heart you must earn it how asked the woodman help dorothy to kill the
wicked witch of the west replied the beast when the witch is dead come to me and i will then give you the biggest and kindest and most loving heart in all the land of oz
so the tin woodman was forced to return sorrowfully to his friends and tell them of the terrible beast he had seen they all wondered greatly at the many forms the
great wizard could take upon himself and the lion said if he is a beast when i go to see him i shall roar my loudest and so frighten him that he will grant all i ask and if
he is the lovely lady i shall pretend to spring upon her and so compel her to do my bidding and if he is the great head he will be at my mercy for i will roll this head all
about the room until he promises to give us what we desire so be of good cheer my friends for all will yet be well the next morning the soldier with the green whiskers
led the lion to the great throne room and bade him enter the presence of oz the lion at once passed through the door and glancing around saw to his surprise that
before the throne was a ball of fire so fierce and glowing he could scarcely bear to gaze upon it his first thought was that oz had by accident caught on fire and was
burning up but when he tried to go nearer the heat was so intense that it singed his whiskers and he crept back tremblingly to a spot nearer the door then a low quiet
voice came from the ball of fire and these were the words it spoke i am oz the great and terrible who are you and why do you seek me and the lion answered i am a cowardly
lion afraid of everything i came to you to beg that you give me courage so that in reality i may become the king of beasts as men call me why should i give you courage
demanded oz because of all wizards you are the greatest and alone have power to grant my request answered the lion the ball of fire burned fiercely for a time and the
voice said bring me proof that the wicked witch is dead and that moment i will give you courage but as long as the witch lives you must remain a coward the lion was
angry at this speech but could say nothing in reply and while he stood silently gazing at the ball of fire it became so furiously hot that he turned tail and rushed
from the room he was glad to find his friends waiting for him and told them of his terrible interview with the wizard what shall we do now asked dorothy sadly there is
only one thing we can do returned the lion and that is to go to the land of the winkies seek out the wicked witch and destroy her but suppose we cannot said the girl then
i shall never have courage declared the lion and i shall never have brains added the scarecrow and i shall never have a heart spoke the tin woodman and i shall never
see aunt em and uncle henry said dorothy beginning to cry be careful cried the green girl the tears will fall on your green silk gown and spot it so dorothy dried her
eyes and said i suppose we must try it but i am sure i do not want to kill anybody even to see aunt em again i will go with you but im too much of a coward to kill the witch
said the lion i will go too declared the scarecrow but i shall not be of much help to you i am such a fool i havent the heart to harm even a witch remarked the tin woodman
but if you go i certainly shall go with you therefore it was decided to start upon their journey the next morning and the woodman sharpened his axe on a green
grindstone and had all his joints properly oiled the scarecrow stuffed himself with fresh straw and dorothy put new paint on his eyes that he might see better the
green girl who was very kind to them filled dorothys basket with good things to eat and fastened a little bell around totos neck with a green ribbon they went to bed
quite early and slept soundly until daylight when they were awakened by the crowing of a green cock that lived in the back yard of the palace and the cackling of a hen
that had laid a green egg the soldier with the green whiskers led them through the streets of the emerald city until they reached the room where the guardian of the
gates lived this officer unlocked their spectacles to put them back in his great box and then he politely opened the gate for our friends which road leads to the
wicked witch of the west asked dorothy there is no road answered the guardian of the gates no one ever wishes to go that way how then are we to find her inquired the
girl that will be easy replied the man for when she knows you are in the country of the winkies she will find you and make you all her slaves perhaps not said the
scarecrow for we mean to destroy her oh that is different said the guardian of the gates no one has ever destroyed her before so i naturally thought she would make
slaves of you as she has of the rest but take care for she is wicked and fierce and may not allow you to destroy her keep to the west where the sun sets and you cannot fail
to find her they thanked him and bade him good bye and turned toward the west walking over fields of soft grass dotted here and there with daisies and buttercups
dorothy still wore the pretty silk dress she had put on in the palace but now to her surprise she found it was no longer green but pure white the ribbon around totos
neck had also lost its green color and was as white as dorothys dress the emerald city was soon left far behind as they advanced the ground became rougher and
hillier for there were no farms nor houses in this country of the west and the ground was untilled in the afternoon the sun shone hot in their faces for there were no
trees to offer them shade so that before night dorothy and toto and the lion were tired and lay down upon the grass and fell asleep with the woodman and the scarecrow
keeping watch now the wicked witch of the west had but one eye yet that was as powerful as a telescope and could see everywhere so as she sat in the door of her castle
she happened to look around and saw dorothy lying asleep with her friends all about her they were a long distance off but the wicked witch was angry to find them in
her country so she blew upon a silver whistle that hung around her neck at once there came running to her from all directions a pack of great wolves they had long legs
and fierce eyes and sharp teeth go to those people said the witch and tear them to pieces are you not going to make them your slaves asked the leader of the wolves no
she answered one is of tin and one of straw one is a girl and another a lion none of them is fit to work so you may tear them into small pieces very well said the wolf and he
dashed away at full speed followed by the others it was lucky the scarecrow and the woodman were wide awake and heard the wolves coming this is my fight said the
woodman so get behind me and i will meet them as they come he seized his axe which he had made very sharp and as the leader of the wolves came on the tin woodman swung his
arm and chopped the wolfs head from its body so that it immediately died as soon as he could raise his axe another wolf came up and he also fell under the sharp edge of
the tin woodmans weapon there were forty wolves and forty times a wolf was killed so that at last they all lay dead in a heap before the woodman then he put down his axe
and sat beside the scarecrow who said it was a good fight friend they waited until dorothy awoke the next morning the little girl was quite frightened when she saw
the great pile of shaggy wolves but the tin woodman told her all she thanked him for saving them and sat down to breakfast after which they started again upon their
journey now this same morning the wicked witch came to the door of her castle and looked out with her one eye that could see far off she saw all her wolves lying dead
and the strangers still traveling through her country this made her angrier than before and she blew her silver whistle twice straightway a great flock of wild
crows came flying toward her enough to darken the sky and the wicked witch said to the king crow fly at once to the strangers peck out their eyes and tear them to
pieces the wild crows flew in one great flock toward dorothy and her companions when the little girl saw them coming she was afraid but the scarecrow said this is my
battle so lie down beside me and you will not be harmed so they all lay upon the ground except the scarecrow and he stood up and stretched out his arms and when the
crows saw him they were frightened as these birds always are by scarecrows and did not dare to come any nearer but the king crow said it is only a stuffed man i will
peck his eyes out the king crow flew at the scarecrow who caught it by the head and twisted its neck until it died and then another crow flew at him and the scarecrow
twisted its neck also there were forty crows and forty times the scarecrow twisted a neck until at last all were lying dead beside him then he called to his
companions to rise and again they went upon their journey when the wicked witch looked out again and saw all her crows lying in a heap she got into a terrible rage and
blew three times upon her silver whistle forthwith there was heard a great buzzing in the air and a swarm of black bees came flying toward her go to the strangers and
sting them to death commanded the witch and the bees turned and flew rapidly until they came to where dorothy and her friends were walking but the woodman had seen
them coming and the scarecrow had decided what to do take out my straw and scatter it over the little girl and the dog and the lion he said to the woodman and the bees
cannot sting them this the woodman did and as dorothy lay close beside the lion and held toto in her arms the straw covered them entirely the bees came and found no
one but the woodman to sting so they flew at him and broke off all their stings against the tin without hurting the woodman at all and as bees cannot live when their
stings are broken that was the end of the black bees and they lay scattered thick about the woodman like little heaps of fine coal then dorothy and the lion got up and
the girl helped the tin woodman put the straw back into the scarecrow again until he was as good as ever so they started upon their journey once more the wicked witch
was so angry when she saw her black bees in little heaps like fine coal that she stamped her foot and tore her hair and gnashed her teeth and then she called a dozen of
her slaves who were the winkies and gave them sharp spears telling them to go to the strangers and destroy them the winkies were not a brave people but they had to do
as they were told so they marched away until they came near to dorothy then the lion gave a great roar and sprang towards them and the poor winkies were so frightened
that they ran back as fast as they could when they returned to the castle the wicked witch beat them well with a strap and sent them back to their work after which she
sat down to think what she should do next she could not understand how all her plans to destroy these strangers had failed but she was a powerful witch as well as a
wicked one and she soon made up her mind how to act there was in her cupboard a golden cap with a circle of diamonds and rubies running round it this golden cap had a
charm whoever owned it could call three times upon the winged monkeys who would obey any order they were given but no person could command these strange creatures
more than three times twice already the wicked witch had used the charm of the cap once was when she had made the winkies her slaves and set herself to rule over their
country the winged monkeys had helped her do this the second time was when she had fought against the great oz himself and driven him out of the land of the west the
winged monkeys had also helped her in doing this only once more could she use this golden cap for which reason she did not like to do so until all her other powers were
exhausted but now that her fierce wolves and her wild crows and her stinging bees were gone and her slaves had been scared away by the cowardly lion she saw there was
only one way left to destroy dorothy and her friends so the wicked witch took the golden cap from her cupboard and placed it upon her head then she stood upon her left
foot and said slowly ep pe pep pe kak ke next she stood upon her right foot and said hillo hollo hello after this she stood upon both feet and cried in a loud voice zizzy
zuzzy zik now the charm began to work the sky was darkened and a low rumbling sound was heard in the air there was a rushing of many wings a great chattering and
laughing and the sun came out of the dark sky to show the wicked witch surrounded by a crowd of monkeys each with a pair of immense and powerful wings on his shoulders
one much bigger than the others seemed to be their leader he flew close to the witch and said you have called us for the third and last time what do you command go to the
strangers who are within my land and destroy them all except the lion said the wicked witch bring that beast to me for i have a mind to harness him like a horse and make
him work your commands shall be obeyed said the leader then with a great deal of chattering and noise the winged monkeys flew away to the place where dorothy and her
friends were walking some of the monkeys seized the tin woodman and carried him through the air until they were over a country thickly covered with sharp rocks
here they dropped the poor woodman who fell a great distance to the rocks where he lay so battered and dented that he could neither move nor groan others of the
monkeys caught the scarecrow and with their long fingers pulled all of the straw out of his clothes and head they made his hat and boots and clothes into a small
bundle and threw it into the top branches of a tall tree the remaining monkeys threw pieces of stout rope around the lion and wound many coils about his body and head
and legs until he was unable to bite or scratch or struggle in any way then they lifted him up and flew away with him to the witchs castle where he was placed in a small
yard with a high iron fence around it so that he could not escape but dorothy they did not harm at all she stood with toto in her arms watching the sad fate of her
comrades and thinking it would soon be her turn the leader of the winged monkeys flew up to her his long hairy arms stretched out and his ugly face grinning terribly
but he saw the mark of the good witchs kiss upon her forehead and stopped short motioning the others not to touch her we dare not harm this little girl he said to them
for she is protected by the power of good and that is greater than the power of evil all we can do is to carry her to the castle of the wicked witch and leave her there so
carefully and gently they lifted dorothy in their arms and carried her swiftly through the air until they came to the castle where they set her down upon the front
doorstep then the leader said to the witch we have obeyed you as far as we were able the tin woodman and the scarecrow are destroyed and the lion is tied up in your yard
the little girl we dare not harm nor the dog she carries in her arms your power over our band is now ended and you will never see us again then all the winged monkeys
with much laughing and chattering and noise flew into the air and were soon out of sight the wicked witch was both surprised and worried when she saw the mark on
dorothys forehead for she knew well that neither the winged monkeys nor she herself dare hurt the girl in any way she looked down at dorothys feet and seeing the
silver shoes began to tremble with fear for she knew what a powerful charm belonged to them at first the witch was tempted to run away from dorothy but she happened
to look into the childs eyes and saw how simple the soul behind them was and that the little girl did not know of the wonderful power the silver shoes gave her so the
wicked witch laughed to herself and thought i can still make her my slave for she does not know how to use her power then she said to dorothy harshly and severely come
with me and see that you mind everything i tell you for if you do not i will make an end of you as i did of the tin woodman and the scarecrow dorothy followed her through
many of the beautiful rooms in her castle until they came to the kitchen where the witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed
with wood dorothy went to work meekly with her mind made up to work as hard as she could for she was glad the wicked witch had decided not to kill her with dorothy hard
at work the witch thought she would go into the courtyard and harness the cowardly lion like a horse it would amuse her she was sure to make him draw her chariot
whenever she wished to go to drive but as she opened the gate the lion gave a loud roar and bounded at her so fiercely that the witch was afraid and ran out and shut the
gate again if i cannot harness you said the witch to the lion speaking through the bars of the gate i can starve you you shall have nothing to eat until you do as i wish
so after that she took no food to the imprisoned lion but every day she came to the gate at noon and asked are you ready to be harnessed like a horse and the lion would
answer no if you come in this yard i will bite you the reason the lion did not have to do as the witch wished was that every night while the woman was asleep dorothy
carried him food from the cupboard after he had eaten he would lie down on his bed of straw and dorothy would lie beside him and put her head on his soft shaggy mane
while they talked of their troubles and tried to plan some way to escape but they could find no way to get out of the castle for it was constantly guarded by the yellow
winkies who were the slaves of the wicked witch and too afraid of her not to do as she told them the girl had to work hard during the day and often the witch threatened
to beat her with the same old umbrella she always carried in her hand but in truth she did not dare to strike dorothy because of the mark upon her forehead the child
did not know this and was full of fear for herself and toto once the witch struck toto a blow with her umbrella and the brave little dog flew at her and bit her leg in
return the witch did not bleed where she was bitten for she was so wicked that the blood in her had dried up many years before dorothys life became very sad as she grew
to understand that it would be harder than ever to get back to kansas and aunt em again sometimes she would cry bitterly for hours with toto sitting at her feet and
looking into her face whining dismally to show how sorry he was for his little mistress toto did not really care whether he was in kansas or the land of oz so long as
dorothy was with him but he knew the little girl was unhappy and that made him unhappy too now the wicked witch had a great longing to have for her own the silver shoes
which the girl always wore her bees and her crows and her wolves were lying in heaps and drying up and she had used up all the power of the golden cap but if she could
only get hold of the silver shoes they would give her more power than all the other things she had lost she watched dorothy carefully to see if she ever took off her
shoes thinking she might steal them but the child was so proud of her pretty shoes that she never took them off except at night and when she took her bath the witch was
too much afraid of the dark to dare go in dorothys room at night to take the shoes and her dread of water was greater than her fear of the dark so she never came near when
dorothy was bathing indeed the old witch never touched water nor ever let water touch her in any way but the wicked creature was very cunning and she finally
thought of a trick that would give her what she wanted she placed a bar of iron in the middle of the kitchen floor and then by her magic arts made the iron invisible to
human eyes so that when dorothy walked across the floor she stumbled over the bar not being able to see it and fell at full length she was not much hurt but in her fall
one of the silver shoes came off and before she could reach it the witch had snatched it away and put it on her own skinny foot the wicked woman was greatly pleased
with the success of her trick for as long as she had one of the shoes she owned half the power of their charm and dorothy could not use it against her even had she known
how to do so the little girl seeing she had lost one of her pretty shoes grew angry and said to the witch give me back my shoe i will not retorted the witch for it is now my
shoe and not yours you are a wicked creature cried dorothy you have no right to take my shoe from me i shall keep it just the same said the witch laughing at her and
someday i shall get the other one from you too this made dorothy so very angry that she picked up the bucket of water that stood near and dashed it over the witch
wetting her from head to foot instantly the wicked woman gave a loud cry of fear and then as dorothy looked at her in wonder the witch began to shrink and fall away see
what you have done she screamed in a minute i shall melt away im very sorry indeed said dorothy who was truly frightened to see the witch actually melting away like
brown sugar before her very eyes didnt you know water would be the end of me asked the witch in a wailing despairing voice of course not answered dorothy how should i
well in a few minutes i shall be all melted and you will have the castle to yourself i have been wicked in my day but i never thought a little girl like you would ever be
able to melt me and end my wicked deeds look out here i go with these words the witch fell down in a brown melted shapeless mass and began to spread over the clean
boards of the kitchen floor seeing that she had really melted away to nothing dorothy drew another bucket of water and threw it over the mess she then swept it all
out the door after picking out the silver shoe which was all that was left of the old woman she cleaned and dried it with a cloth and put it on her foot again then being
at last free to do as she chose she ran out to the courtyard to tell the lion that the wicked witch of the west had come to an end and that they were no longer prisoners in
a strange land the cowardly lion was much pleased to hear that the wicked witch had been melted by a bucket of water and dorothy at once unlocked the gate of his
prison and set him free they went in together to the castle where dorothys first act was to call all the winkies together and tell them that they were no longer
slaves there was great rejoicing among the yellow winkies for they had been made to work hard during many years for the wicked witch who had always treated them
with great cruelty they kept this day as a holiday then and ever after and spent the time in feasting and dancing if our friends the scarecrow and the tin woodman
were only with us said the lion i should be quite happy dont you suppose we could rescue them asked the girl anxiously we can try answered the lion so they called the
yellow winkies and asked them if they would help to rescue their friends and the winkies said that they would be delighted to do all in their power for dorothy who
had set them free from bondage so she chose a number of the winkies who looked as if they knew the most and they all started away they traveled that day and part of the
next until they came to the rocky plain where the tin woodman lay all battered and bent his axe was near him but the blade was rusted and the handle broken off short
the winkies lifted him tenderly in their arms and carried him back to the yellow castle again dorothy shedding a few tears by the way at the sad plight of her old
friend and the lion looking sober and sorry when they reached the castle dorothy said to the winkies are any of your people tinsmiths oh yes some of us are very good
tinsmiths they told her then bring them to me she said and when the tinsmiths came bringing with them all their tools in baskets she inquired can you straighten out
those dents in the tin woodman and bend him back into shape again and solder him together where he is broken the tinsmiths looked the woodman over carefully and
then answered that they thought they could mend him so he would be as good as ever so they set to work in one of the big yellow rooms of the castle and worked for three
days and four nights hammering and twisting and bending and soldering and polishing and pounding at the legs and body and head of the tin woodman until at last he
was straightened out into his old form and his joints worked as well as ever to be sure there were several patches on him but the tinsmiths did a good job and as the
woodman was not a vain man he did not mind the patches at all when at last he walked into dorothys room and thanked her for rescuing him he was so pleased that he wept
tears of joy and dorothy had to wipe every tear carefully from his face with her apron so his joints would not be rusted at the same time her own tears fell thick and
fast at the joy of meeting her old friend again and these tears did not need to be wiped away as for the lion he wiped his eyes so often with the tip of his tail that it
became quite wet and he was obliged to go out into the courtyard and hold it in the sun till it dried if we only had the scarecrow with us again said the tin woodman when
dorothy had finished telling him everything that had happened i should be quite happy we must try to find him said the girl so she called the winkies to help her and
they walked all that day and part of the next until they came to the tall tree in the branches of which the winged monkeys had tossed the scarecrows clothes it was a
very tall tree and the trunk was so smooth that no one could climb it but the woodman said at once ill chop it down and then we can get the scarecrows clothes now while
the tinsmiths had been at work mending the woodman himself another of the winkies who was a goldsmith had made an axe handle of solid gold and fitted it to the
woodmans axe instead of the old broken handle others polished the blade until all the rust was removed and it glistened like burnished silver as soon as he had
spoken the tin woodman began to chop and in a short time the tree fell over with a crash whereupon the scarecrows clothes fell out of the branches and rolled off on
the ground dorothy picked them up and had the winkies carry them back to the castle where they were stuffed with nice clean straw and behold here was the scarecrow
as good as ever thanking them over and over again for saving him now that they were reunited dorothy and her friends spent a few happy days at the yellow castle where
they found everything they needed to make them comfortable but one day the girl thought of aunt em and said we must go back to oz and claim his promise yes said the
woodman at last i shall get my heart and i shall get my brains added the scarecrow joyfully and i shall get my courage said the lion thoughtfully and i shall get back
to kansas cried dorothy clapping her hands oh let us start for the emerald city tomorrow this they decided to do the next day they called the winkies together and
bade them good bye the winkies were sorry to have them go and they had grown so fond of the tin woodman that they begged him to stay and rule over them and the yellow
land of the west finding they were determined to go the winkies gave toto and the lion each a golden collar and to dorothy they presented a beautiful bracelet
studded with diamonds and to the scarecrow they gave a gold headed walking stick to keep him from stumbling and to the tin woodman they offered a silver oil can
inlaid with gold and set with precious jewels every one of the travelers made the winkies a pretty speech in return and all shook hands with them until their arms
ached dorothy went to the witchs cupboard to fill her basket with food for the journey and there she saw the golden cap she tried it on her own head and found that it
fitted her exactly she did not know anything about the charm of the golden cap but she saw that it was pretty so she made up her mind to wear it and carry her sunbonnet
in the basket then being prepared for the journey they all started for the emerald city and the winkies gave them three cheers and many good wishes to carry with
them you will remember there was no road not even a pathway between the castle of the wicked witch and the emerald city when the four travelers went in search of the
witch she had seen them coming and so sent the winged monkeys to bring them to her it was much harder to find their way back through the big fields of buttercups and
yellow daisies than it was being carried they knew of course they must go straight east toward the rising sun and they started off in the right way but at noon when
the sun was over their heads they did not know which was east and which was west and that was the reason they were lost in the great fields they kept on walking however
and at night the moon came out and shone brightly so they lay down among the sweet smelling yellow flowers and slept soundly until morning all but the scarecrow and
the tin woodman the next morning the sun was behind a cloud but they started on as if they were quite sure which way they were going if we walk far enough said dorothy i
am sure we shall sometime come to some place but day by day passed away and they still saw nothing before them but the scarlet fields the scarecrow began to grumble a
bit we have surely lost our way he said and unless we find it again in time to reach the emerald city i shall never get my brains nor i my heart declared the tin woodman
it seems to me i can scarcely wait till i get to oz and you must admit this is a very long journey you see said the cowardly lion with a whimper i havent the courage to
keep tramping forever without getting anywhere at all then dorothy lost heart she sat down on the grass and looked at her companions and they sat down and looked at
her and toto found that for the first time in his life he was too tired to chase a butterfly that flew past his head so he put out his tongue and panted and looked at
dorothy as if to ask what they should do next suppose we call the field mice she suggested they could probably tell us the way to the emerald city to be sure they could
cried the scarecrow why didnt we think of that before dorothy blew the little whistle she had always carried about her neck since the queen of the mice had given it
to her in a few minutes they heard the pattering of tiny feet and many of the small gray mice came running up to her among them was the queen herself who asked in her
squeaky little voice what can i do for my friends we have lost our way said dorothy can you tell us where the emerald city is certainly answered the queen but it is a
great way off for you have had it at your backs all this time then she noticed dorothys golden cap and said why dont you use the charm of the cap and call the winged
monkeys to you they will carry you to the city of oz in less than an hour i didnt know there was a charm answered dorothy in surprise what is it it is written inside the
golden cap replied the queen of the mice but if you are going to call the winged monkeys we must run away for they are full of mischief and think it great fun to plague
us wont they hurt me asked the girl anxiously oh no they must obey the wearer of the cap good bye and she scampered out of sight with all the mice hurrying after her
dorothy looked inside the golden cap and saw some words written upon the lining these she thought must be the charm so she read the directions carefully and put the
cap upon her head ep pe pep pe kak ke she said standing on her left foot what did you say asked the scarecrow who did not know what she was doing hil lo hol lo hel lo
dorothy went on standing this time on her right foot hello replied the tin woodman calmly zizzy zuzzy zik said dorothy who was now standing on both feet this ended
the saying of the charm and they heard a great chattering and flapping of wings as the band of winged monkeys flew up to them the king bowed low before dorothy and
asked what is your command we wish to go to the emerald city said the child and we have lost our way we will carry you replied the king and no sooner had he spoken than
two of the monkeys caught dorothy in their arms and flew away with her others took the scarecrow and the woodman and the lion and one little monkey seized toto and
flew after them although the dog tried hard to bite him the scarecrow and the tin woodman were rather frightened at first for they remembered how badly the winged
monkeys had treated them before but they saw that no harm was intended so they rode through the air quite cheerfully and had a fine time looking at the pretty
gardens and woods far below them dorothy found herself riding easily between two of the biggest monkeys one of them the king himself they had made a chair of their
hands and were careful not to hurt her why do you have to obey the charm of the golden cap she asked that is a long story answered the king with a winged laugh but as we
have a long journey before us i will pass the time by telling you about it if you wish i shall be glad to hear it she replied once began the leader we were a free people
living happily in the great forest flying from tree to tree eating nuts and fruit and doing just as we pleased without calling anybody master perhaps some of us
were rather too full of mischief at times flying down to pull the tails of the animals that had no wings chasing birds and throwing nuts at the people who walked in
the forest but we were careless and happy and full of fun and enjoyed every minute of the day this was many years ago long before oz came out of the clouds to rule over
this land there lived here then away at the north a beautiful princess who was also a powerful sorceress all her magic was used to help the people and she was never
known to hurt anyone who was good her name was gayelette and she lived in a handsome palace built from great blocks of ruby everyone loved her but her greatest
sorrow was that she could find no one to love in return since all the men were much too stupid and ugly to mate with one so beautiful and wise at last however she found a
boy who was handsome and manly and wise beyond his years gayelette made up her mind that when he grew to be a man she would make him her husband so she took him to her
ruby palace and used all her magic powers to make him as strong and good and lovely as any woman could wish when he grew to manhood quelala as he was called was said to
be the best and wisest man in all the land while his manly beauty was so great that gayelette loved him dearly and hastened to make everything ready for the wedding
my grandfather was at that time the king of the winged monkeys which lived in the forest near gayelettes palace and the old fellow loved a joke better than a good
dinner one day just before the wedding my grandfather was flying out with his band when he saw quelala walking beside the river he was dressed in a rich costume of
pink silk and purple velvet and my grandfather thought he would see what he could do at his word the band flew down and seized quelala carried him in their arms until
they were over the middle of the river and then dropped him into the water swim out my fine fellow cried my grandfather and see if the water has spotted your clothes
quelala was much too wise not to swim and he was not in the least spoiled by all his good fortune he laughed when he came to the top of the water and swam in to shore but
when gayelette came running out to him she found his silks and velvet all ruined by the river the princess was angry and she knew of course who did it she had all the
winged monkeys brought before her and she said at first that their wings should be tied and they should be treated as they had treated quelala and dropped in the
river but my grandfather pleaded hard for he knew the monkeys would drown in the river with their wings tied and quelala said a kind word for them also so that
gayelette finally spared them on condition that the winged monkeys should ever after do three times the bidding of the owner of the golden cap this cap had been
made for a wedding present to quelala and it is said to have cost the princess half her kingdom of course my grandfather and all the other monkeys at once agreed to
the condition and that is how it happens that we are three times the slaves of the owner of the golden cap whosoever he may be and what became of them asked dorothy who
had been greatly interested in the story quelala being the first owner of the golden cap replied the monkey he was the first to lay his wishes upon us as his bride
could not bear the sight of us he called us all to him in the forest after he had married her and ordered us always to keep where she could never again set eyes on a
winged monkey which we were glad to do for we were all afraid of her this was all we ever had to do until the golden cap fell into the hands of the wicked witch of the west
who made us enslave the winkies and afterward drive oz himself out of the land of the west now the golden cap is yours and three times you have the right to lay your
wishes upon us as the monkey king finished his story dorothy looked down and saw the green shining walls of the emerald city before them she wondered at the rapid
flight of the monkeys but was glad the journey was over the strange creatures set the travelers down carefully before the gate of the city the king bowed low to
dorothy and then flew swiftly away followed by all his band that was a good ride said the little girl yes and a quick way out of our troubles replied the lion how lucky
it was you brought away that wonderful cap the four travelers walked up to the great gate of emerald city and rang the bell after ringing several times it was opened
by the same guardian of the gates they had met before what are you back again he asked in surprise do you not see us answered the scarecrow but i thought you had gone to
visit the wicked witch of the west we did visit her said the scarecrow and she let you go again asked the man in wonder she could not help it for she is melted explained
the scarecrow melted well that is good news indeed said the man who melted her it was dorothy said the lion gravely good gracious exclaimed the man and he bowed very
low indeed before her then he led them into his little room and locked the spectacles from the great box on all their eyes just as he had done before afterward they
passed on through the gate into the emerald city when the people heard from the guardian of the gates that dorothy had melted the wicked witch of the west they all
gathered around the travelers and followed them in a great crowd to the palace of oz the soldier with the green whiskers was still on guard before the door but he let
them in at once and they were again met by the beautiful green girl who showed each of them to their old rooms at once so they might rest until the great oz was ready to
receive them the soldier had the news carried straight to oz that dorothy and the other travelers had come back again after destroying the wicked witch but oz made
no reply they thought the great wizard would send for them at once but he did not they had no word from him the next day nor the next nor the next the waiting was
tiresome and wearing and at last they grew vexed that oz should treat them in so poor a fashion after sending them to undergo hardships and slavery so the scarecrow
at last asked the green girl to take another message to oz saying if he did not let them in to see him at once they would call the winged monkeys to help them and find out
whether he kept his promises or not when the wizard was given this message he was so frightened that he sent word for them to come to the throne room at four minutes
after nine oclock the next morning he had once met the winged monkeys in the land of the west and he did not wish to meet them again the four travelers passed a
sleepless night each thinking of the gift oz had promised to bestow on him dorothy fell asleep only once and then she dreamed she was in kansas where aunt em was
telling her how glad she was to have her little girl at home again promptly at nine oclock the next morning the green whiskered soldier came to them and four minutes
later they all went into the throne room of the great oz of course each one of them expected to see the wizard in the shape he had taken before and all were greatly
surprised when they looked about and saw no one at all in the room they kept close to the door and closer to one another for the stillness of the empty room was more
dreadful than any of the forms they had seen oz take presently they heard a solemn voice that seemed to come from somewhere near the top of the great dome and it said i
am oz the great and terrible why do you seek me they looked again in every part of the room and then seeing no one dorothy asked where are you i am everywhere answered
the voice but to the eyes of common mortals i am invisible i will now seat myself upon my throne that you may converse with me indeed the voice seemed just then to come
straight from the throne itself so they walked toward it and stood in a row while dorothy said we have come to claim our promise o oz what promise asked oz you
promised to send me back to kansas when the wicked witch was destroyed said the girl and you promised to give me brains said the scarecrow and you promised to give me
a heart said the tin woodman and you promised to give me courage said the cowardly lion is the wicked witch really destroyed asked the voice and dorothy thought it
trembled a little yes she answered i melted her with a bucket of water dear me said the voice how sudden well come to me tomorrow for i must have time to think it over
youve had plenty of time already said the tin woodman angrily we shant wait a day longer said the scarecrow you must keep your promises to us exclaimed dorothy the
lion thought it might be as well to frighten the wizard so he gave a large loud roar which was so fierce and dreadful that toto jumped away from him in alarm and tipped
over the screen that stood in a corner as it fell with a crash they looked that way and the next moment all of them were filled with wonder for they saw standing in just
the spot the screen had hidden a little old man with a bald head and a wrinkled face who seemed to be as much surprised as they were the tin woodman raising his axe
rushed toward the little man and cried out who are you i am oz the great and terrible said the little man in a trembling voice but dont strike me please dont and ill do
anything you want me to our friends looked at him in surprise and dismay i thought oz was a great head said dorothy and i thought oz was a lovely lady said the
scarecrow and i thought oz was a terrible beast said the tin woodman and i thought oz was a ball of fire exclaimed the lion no you are all wrong said the little man
meekly i have been making believe making believe cried dorothy are you not a great wizard hush my dear he said dont speak so loud or you will be overheard and i should
be ruined im supposed to be a great wizard and arent you she asked not a bit of it my dear im just a common man youre more than that said the scarecrow in a grieved tone
youre a humbug exactly so declared the little man rubbing his hands together as if it pleased him i am a humbug but this is terrible said the tin woodman how shall i
ever get my heart or i my courage asked the lion or i my brains wailed the scarecrow wiping the tears from his eyes with his coat sleeve my dear friends said oz i pray
you not to speak of these little things think of me and the terrible trouble im in at being found out doesnt anyone else know youre a humbug asked dorothy no one knows
it but you four and myself replied oz i have fooled everyone so long that i thought i should never be found out it was a great mistake my ever letting you into the
throne room usually i will not see even my subjects and so they believe i am something terrible but i dont understand said dorothy in bewilderment how was it that
you appeared to me as a great head that was one of my tricks answered oz step this way please and i will tell you all about it he led the way to a small chamber in the rear
of the throne room and they all followed him he pointed to one corner in which lay the great head made out of many thicknesses of paper and with a carefully painted
face this i hung from the ceiling by a wire said oz i stood behind the screen and pulled a thread to make the eyes move and the mouth open but how about the voice she
inquired oh i am a ventriloquist said the little man i can throw the sound of my voice wherever i wish so that you thought it was coming out of the head here are the
other things i used to deceive you he showed the scarecrow the dress and the mask he had worn when he seemed to be the lovely lady and the tin woodman saw that his
terrible beast was nothing but a lot of skins sewn together with slats to keep their sides out as for the ball of fire the false wizard had hung that also from the
ceiling it was really a ball of cotton but when oil was poured upon it the ball burned fiercely really said the scarecrow you ought to be ashamed of yourself for
being such a humbug i am i certainly am answered the little man sorrowfully but it was the only thing i could do sit down please there are plenty of chairs and i will
tell you my story so they sat down and listened while he told the following tale i was born in omaha why that isnt very far from kansas cried dorothy no but its farther
from here he said shaking his head at her sadly when i grew up i became a ventriloquist and at that i was very well trained by a great master i can imitate any kind of a
bird or beast here he mewed so like a kitten that toto pricked up his ears and looked everywhere to see where she was after a time continued oz i tired of that and
became a balloonist what is that asked dorothy a man who goes up in a balloon on circus day so as to draw a crowd of people together and get them to pay to see the circus
he explained oh she said i know well one day i went up in a balloon and the ropes got twisted so that i couldnt come down again it went way up above the clouds so far that a
current of air struck it and carried it many many miles away for a day and a night i traveled through the air and on the morning of the second day i awoke and found the
balloon floating over a strange and beautiful country it came down gradually and i was not hurt a bit but i found myself in the midst of a strange people who seeing me
come from the clouds thought i was a great wizard of course i let them think so because they were afraid of me and promised to do anything i wished them to just to amuse
myself and keep the good people busy i ordered them to build this city and my palace and they did it all willingly and well then i thought as the country was so green
and beautiful i would call it the emerald city and to make the name fit better i put green spectacles on all the people so that everything they saw was green but isnt
everything here green asked dorothy no more than in any other city replied oz but when you wear green spectacles why of course everything you see looks green to you
the emerald city was built a great many years ago for i was a young man when the balloon brought me here and i am a very old man now but my people have worn green glasses
on their eyes so long that most of them think it really is an emerald city and it certainly is a beautiful place abounding in jewels and precious metals and every
good thing that is needed to make one happy i have been good to the people and they like me but ever since this palace was built i have shut myself up and would not see
any of them one of my greatest fears was the witches for while i had no magical powers at all i soon found out that the witches were really able to do wonderful things
there were four of them in this country and they ruled the people who live in the north and south and east and west fortunately the witches of the north and south were
good and i knew they would do me no harm but the witches of the east and west were terribly wicked and had they not thought i was more powerful than they themselves
they would surely have destroyed me as it was i lived in deadly fear of them for many years so you can imagine how pleased i was when i heard your house had fallen on the
wicked witch of the east when you came to me i was willing to promise anything if you would only do away with the other witch but now that you have melted her i am
ashamed to say that i cannot keep my promises i think you are a very bad man said dorothy oh no my dear im really a very good man but im a very bad wizard i must admit cant
you give me brains asked the scarecrow you dont need them you are learning something every day a baby has brains but it doesnt know much experience is the only thing
that brings knowledge and the longer you are on earth the more experience you are sure to get that may all be true said the scarecrow but i shall be very unhappy
unless you give me brains the false wizard looked at him carefully well he said with a sigh im not much of a magician as i said but if you will come to me tomorrow
morning i will stuff your head with brains i cannot tell you how to use them however you must find that out for yourself oh thank you thank you cried the scarecrow ill
find a way to use them never fear but how about my courage asked the lion anxiously you have plenty of courage i am sure answered oz all you need is confidence in
yourself there is no living thing that is not afraid when it faces danger the true courage is in facing danger when you are afraid and that kind of courage you have in
plenty perhaps i have but im scared just the same said the lion i shall really be very unhappy unless you give me the sort of courage that makes one forget he is afraid
very well i will give you that sort of courage tomorrow replied oz how about my heart asked the tin woodman why as for that answered oz i think you are wrong to want a
heart it makes most people unhappy if you only knew it you are in luck not to have a heart that must be a matter of opinion said the tin woodman for my part i will bear all
the unhappiness without a murmur if you will give me the heart very well answered oz meekly come to me tomorrow and you shall have a heart i have played wizard for so
many years that i may as well continue the part a little longer and now said dorothy how am i to get back to kansas we shall have to think about that replied the little
man give me two or three days to consider the matter and ill try to find a way to carry you over the desert in the meantime you shall all be treated as my guests and while
you live in the palace my people will wait upon you and obey your slightest wish there is only one thing i ask in return for my help such as it is you must keep my secret
and tell no one i am a humbug they agreed to say nothing of what they had learned and went back to their rooms in high spirits even dorothy had hope that the great and
terrible humbug as she called him would find a way to send her back to kansas and if he did she was willing to forgive him everything next morning the scarecrow said
to his friends congratulate me i am going to oz to get my brains at last when i return i shall be as other men are i have always liked you as you were said dorothy simply
it is kind of you to like a scarecrow he replied but surely you will think more of me when you hear the splendid thoughts my new brain is going to turn out then he said
good bye to them all in a cheerful voice and went to the throne room where he rapped upon the door come in said oz the scarecrow went in and found the little man sitting
down by the window engaged in deep thought i have come for my brains remarked the scarecrow a little uneasily oh yes sit down in that chair please replied oz you must
excuse me for taking your head off but i shall have to do it in order to put your brains in their proper place thats all right said the scarecrow you are quite welcome
to take my head off as long as it will be a better one when you put it on again so the wizard unfastened his head and emptied out the straw then he entered the back room
and took up a measure of bran which he mixed with a great many pins and needles having shaken them together thoroughly he filled the top of the scarecrows head with
the mixture and stuffed the rest of the space with straw to hold it in place when he had fastened the scarecrows head on his body again he said to him hereafter you
will be a great man for i have given you a lot of bran new brains the scarecrow was both pleased and proud at the fulfillment of his greatest wish and having thanked oz
warmly he went back to his friends dorothy looked at him curiously his head was quite bulged out at the top with brains how do you feel she asked i feel wise indeed he
answered earnestly when i get used to my brains i shall know everything why are those needles and pins sticking out of your head asked the tin woodman that is proof
that he is sharp remarked the lion well i must go to oz and get my heart said the woodman so he walked to the throne room and knocked at the door come in called oz and the
woodman entered and said i have come for my heart very well answered the little man but i shall have to cut a hole in your breast so i can put your heart in the right
place i hope it wont hurt you oh no answered the woodman i shall not feel it at all so oz brought a pair of tinsmiths shears and cut a small square hole in the left side of
the tin woodmans breast then going to a chest of drawers he took out a pretty heart made entirely of silk and stuffed with sawdust isnt it a beauty he asked it is
indeed replied the woodman who was greatly pleased but is it a kind heart oh very answered oz he put the heart in the woodmans breast and then replaced the square of
tin soldering it neatly together where it had been cut there said he now you have a heart that any man might be proud of im sorry i had to put a patch on your breast but it
really couldnt be helped never mind the patch exclaimed the happy woodman i am very grateful to you and shall never forget your kindness dont speak of it replied oz
then the tin woodman went back to his friends who wished him every joy on account of his good fortune the lion now walked to the throne room and knocked at the door
come in said oz i have come for my courage announced the lion entering the room very well answered the little man i will get it for you he went to a cupboard and
reaching up to a high shelf took down a square green bottle the contents of which he poured into a green gold dish beautifully carved placing this before the
cowardly lion who sniffed at it as if he did not like it the wizard said drink what is it asked the lion well answered oz if it were inside of you it would be courage you
know of course that courage is always inside one so that this really cannot be called courage until you have swallowed it therefore i advise you to drink it as soon
as possible the lion hesitated no longer but drank till the dish was empty how do you feel now asked oz full of courage replied the lion who went joyfully back to his
friends to tell them of his good fortune oz left to himself smiled to think of his success in giving the scarecrow and the tin woodman and the lion exactly what they
thought they wanted how can i help being a humbug he said when all these people make me do things that everybody knows cant be done it was easy to make the scarecrow
and the lion and the woodman happy because they imagined i could do anything but it will take more than imagination to carry dorothy back to kansas and im sure i dont
know how it can be done for three days dorothy heard nothing from oz these were sad days for the little girl although her friends were all quite happy and contented
the scarecrow told them there were wonderful thoughts in his head but he would not say what they were because he knew no one could understand them but himself when
the tin woodman walked about he felt his heart rattling around in his breast and he told dorothy he had discovered it to be a kinder and more tender heart than the one
he had owned when he was made of flesh the lion declared he was afraid of nothing on earth and would gladly face an army or a dozen of the fierce kalidahs thus each of
the little party was satisfied except dorothy who longed more than ever to get back to kansas on the fourth day to her great joy oz sent for her and when she entered
the throne room he greeted her pleasantly sit down my dear i think i have found the way to get you out of this country and back to kansas she asked eagerly well im not
sure about kansas said oz for i havent the faintest notion which way it lies but the first thing to do is to cross the desert and then it should be easy to find your way
home how can i cross the desert she inquired well ill tell you what i think said the little man you see when i came to this country it was in a balloon you also came
through the air being carried by a cyclone so i believe the best way to get across the desert will be through the air now it is quite beyond my powers to make a cyclone
but ive been thinking the matter over and i believe i can make a balloon how asked dorothy a balloon said oz is made of silk which is coated with glue to keep the gas in
it i have plenty of silk in the palace so it will be no trouble to make the balloon but in all this country there is no gas to fill the balloon with to make it float if it
wont float remarked dorothy it will be of no use to us true answered oz but there is another way to make it float which is to fill it with hot air hot air isnt as good as
gas for if the air should get cold the balloon would come down in the desert and we should be lost we exclaimed the girl are you going with me yes of course replied oz i
am tired of being such a humbug if i should go out of this palace my people would soon discover i am not a wizard and then they would be vexed with me for having deceived
them so i have to stay shut up in these rooms all day and it gets tiresome id much rather go back to kansas with you and be in a circus again i shall be glad to have your
company said dorothy thank you he answered now if you will help me sew the silk together we will begin to work on our balloon so dorothy took a needle and thread and as
fast as oz cut the strips of silk into proper shape the girl sewed them neatly together first there was a strip of light green silk then a strip of dark green and then a
strip of emerald green for oz had a fancy to make the balloon in different shades of the color about them it took three days to sew all the strips together but when it
was finished they had a big bag of green silk more than twenty feet long then oz painted it on the inside with a coat of thin glue to make it airtight after which he
announced that the balloon was ready but we must have a basket to ride in he said so he sent the soldier with the green whiskers for a big clothes basket which he
fastened with many ropes to the bottom of the balloon when it was all ready oz sent word to his people that he was going to make a visit to a great brother wizard who
lived in the clouds the news spread rapidly throughout the city and everyone came to see the wonderful sight oz ordered the balloon carried out in front of the
palace and the people gazed upon it with much curiosity the tin woodman had chopped a big pile of wood and now he made a fire of it and oz held the bottom of the balloon
over the fire so that the hot air that arose from it would be caught in the silken bag gradually the balloon swelled out and rose into the air until finally the basket
just touched the ground then oz got into the basket and said to all the people in a loud voice i am now going away to make a visit while i am gone the scarecrow will rule
over you i command you to obey him as you would me the balloon was by this time tugging hard at the rope that held it to the ground for the air within it was hot and this
made it so much lighter in weight than the air without that it pulled hard to rise into the sky come dorothy cried the wizard hurry up or the balloon will fly away i
cant find toto anywhere replied dorothy who did not wish to leave her little dog behind toto had run into the crowd to bark at a kitten and dorothy at last found him
she picked him up and ran towards the balloon she was within a few steps of it and oz was holding out his hands to help her into the basket when crack went the ropes and
the balloon rose into the air without her come back she screamed i want to go too i cant come back my dear called oz from the basket good bye good bye shouted everyone
and all eyes were turned upward to where the wizard was riding in the basket rising every moment farther and farther into the sky and that was the last any of them
ever saw of oz the wonderful wizard though he may have reached omaha safely and be there now for all we know but the people remembered him lovingly and said to one
another oz was always our friend when he was here he built for us this beautiful emerald city and now he is gone he has left the wise scarecrow to rule over us still for
many days they grieved over the loss of the wonderful wizard and would not be comforted dorothy wept bitterly at the passing of her hope to get home to kansas again
but when she thought it all over she was glad she had not gone up in a balloon and she also felt sorry at losing oz and so did her companions the tin woodman came to her
and said truly i should be ungrateful if i failed to mourn for the man who gave me my lovely heart i should like to cry a little because oz is gone if you will kindly wipe
away my tears so that i shall not rust with pleasure she answered and brought a towel at once then the tin woodman wept for several minutes and she watched the tears
carefully and wiped them away with the towel when he had finished he thanked her kindly and oiled himself thoroughly with his jeweled oil can to guard against
mishap the scarecrow was now the ruler of the emerald city and although he was not a wizard the people were proud of him for they said there is not another city in all
the world that is ruled by a stuffed man and so far as they knew they were quite right the morning after the balloon had gone up with oz the four travelers met in the
throne room and talked matters over the scarecrow sat in the big throne and the others stood respectfully before him we are not so unlucky said the new ruler for
this palace and the emerald city belong to us and we can do just as we please when i remember that a short time ago i was up on a pole in a farmers cornfield and that now i
am the ruler of this beautiful city i am quite satisfied with my lot i also said the tin woodman am well pleased with my new heart and really that was the only thing i
wished in all the world for my part i am content in knowing i am as brave as any beast that ever lived if not braver said the lion modestly if dorothy would only be
contented to live in the emerald city continued the scarecrow we might all be happy together but i dont want to live here cried dorothy i want to go to kansas and live
with aunt em and uncle henry well then what can be done inquired the woodman the scarecrow decided to think and he thought so hard that the pins and needles began to
stick out of his brains finally he said why not call the winged monkeys and ask them to carry you over the desert i never thought of that said dorothy joyfully its
just the thing ill go at once for the golden cap when she brought it into the throne room she spoke the magic words and soon the band of winged monkeys flew in through
the open window and stood beside her this is the second time you have called us said the monkey king bowing before the little girl what do you wish i want you to fly
with me to kansas said dorothy but the monkey king shook his head that cannot be done he said we belong to this country alone and cannot leave it there has never been a
winged monkey in kansas yet and i suppose there never will be for they dont belong there we shall be glad to serve you in any way in our power but we cannot cross the
desert good bye and with another bow the monkey king spread his wings and flew away through the window followed by all his band dorothy was ready to cry with
disappointment i have wasted the charm of the golden cap to no purpose she said for the winged monkeys cannot help me it is certainly too bad said the tender hearted
woodman the scarecrow was thinking again and his head bulged out so horribly that dorothy feared it would burst let us call in the soldier with the green whiskers
he said and ask his advice so the soldier was summoned and entered the throne room timidly for while oz was alive he never was allowed to come farther than the door
this little girl said the scarecrow to the soldier wishes to cross the desert how can she do so i cannot tell answered the soldier for nobody has ever crossed the
desert unless it is oz himself is there no one who can help me asked dorothy earnestly glinda might he suggested who is glinda inquired the scarecrow the witch of
the south she is the most powerful of all the witches and rules over the quadlings besides her castle stands on the edge of the desert so she may know a way to cross it
glinda is a good witch isnt she asked the child the quadlings think she is good said the soldier and she is kind to everyone i have heard that glinda is a beautiful
woman who knows how to keep young in spite of the many years she has lived how can i get to her castle asked dorothy the road is straight to the south he answered but it
is said to be full of dangers to travelers there are wild beasts in the woods and a race of queer men who do not like strangers to cross their country for this reason
none of the quadlings ever come to the emerald city the soldier then left them and the scarecrow said it seems in spite of dangers that the best thing dorothy can do
is to travel to the land of the south and ask glinda to help her for of course if dorothy stays here she will never get back to kansas you must have been thinking again
remarked the tin woodman i have said the scarecrow i shall go with dorothy declared the lion for i am tired of your city and long for the woods and the country again i
am really a wild beast you know besides dorothy will need someone to protect her that is true agreed the woodman my axe may be of service to her so i also will go with
her to the land of the south when shall we start asked the scarecrow are you going they asked in surprise certainly if it wasnt for dorothy i should never have had
brains she lifted me from the pole in the cornfield and brought me to the emerald city so my good luck is all due to her and i shall never leave her until she starts back
to kansas for good and all thank you said dorothy gratefully you are all very kind to me but i should like to start as soon as possible we shall go tomorrow morning
returned the scarecrow so now let us all get ready for it will be a long journey the next morning dorothy kissed the pretty green girl good bye and they all shook
hands with the soldier with the green whiskers who had walked with them as far as the gate when the guardian of the gate saw them again he wondered greatly that they
could leave the beautiful city to get into new trouble but he at once unlocked their spectacles which he put back into the green box and gave them many good wishes to
carry with them you are now our ruler he said to the scarecrow so you must come back to us as soon as possible i certainly shall if i am able the scarecrow replied but i
must help dorothy to get home first as dorothy bade the good natured guardian a last farewell she said i have been very kindly treated in your lovely city and
everyone has been good to me i cannot tell you how grateful i am dont try my dear he answered we should like to keep you with us but if it is your wish to return to kansas i
hope you will find a way he then opened the gate of the outer wall and they walked forth and started upon their journey the sun shone brightly as our friends turned
their faces toward the land of the south they were all in the best of spirits and laughed and chatted together dorothy was once more filled with the hope of getting
home and the scarecrow and the tin woodman were glad to be of use to her as for the lion he sniffed the fresh air with delight and whisked his tail from side to side in
pure joy at being in the country again while toto ran around them and chased the moths and butterflies barking merrily all the time city life does not agree with me
at all remarked the lion as they walked along at a brisk pace i have lost much flesh since i lived there and now i am anxious for a chance to show the other beasts how
courageous i have grown they now turned and took a last look at the emerald city all they could see was a mass of towers and steeples behind the green walls and high up
above everything the spires and dome of the palace of oz oz was not such a bad wizard after all said the tin woodman as he felt his heart rattling around in his breast
he knew how to give me brains and very good brains too said the scarecrow if oz had taken a dose of the same courage he gave me added the lion he would have been a brave
man dorothy said nothing oz had not kept the promise he made her but he had done his best so she forgave him as he said he was a good man even if he was a bad wizard the
first days journey was through the green fields and bright flowers that stretched about the emerald city on every side they slept that night on the grass with
nothing but the stars over them and they rested very well indeed in the morning they traveled on until they came to a thick wood there was no way of going around it for
it seemed to extend to the right and left as far as they could see and besides they did not dare change the direction of their journey for fear of getting lost so they
looked for the place where it would be easiest to get into the forest the scarecrow who was in the lead finally discovered a big tree with such wide spreading
branches that there was room for the party to pass underneath so he walked forward to the tree but just as he came under the first branches they bent down and twined
around him and the next minute he was raised from the ground and flung headlong among his fellow travelers this did not hurt the scarecrow but it surprised him and
he looked rather dizzy when dorothy picked him up here is another space between the trees called the lion let me try it first said the scarecrow for it doesnt hurt me
to get thrown about he walked up to another tree as he spoke but its branches immediately seized him and tossed him back again this is strange exclaimed dorothy
what shall we do the trees seem to have made up their minds to fight us and stop our journey remarked the lion i believe i will try it myself said the woodman and
shouldering his axe he marched up to the first tree that had handled the scarecrow so roughly when a big branch bent down to seize him the woodman chopped at it so
fiercely that he cut it in two at once the tree began shaking all its branches as if in pain and the tin woodman passed safely under it come on he shouted to the others
be quick they all ran forward and passed under the tree without injury except toto who was caught by a small branch and shaken until he howled but the woodman
promptly chopped off the branch and set the little dog free the other trees of the forest did nothing to keep them back so they made up their minds that only the first
row of trees could bend down their branches and that probably these were the policemen of the forest and given this wonderful power in order to keep strangers out
of it the four travelers walked with ease through the trees until they came to the farther edge of the wood then to their surprise they found before them a high wall
which seemed to be made of white china it was smooth like the surface of a dish and higher than their heads what shall we do now asked dorothy i will make a ladder said
the tin woodman for we certainly must climb over the wall while the woodman was making a ladder from wood which he found in the forest dorothy lay down and slept for
she was tired by the long walk the lion also curled himself up to sleep and toto lay beside him the scarecrow watched the woodman while he worked and said to him i
cannot think why this wall is here nor what it is made of rest your brains and do not worry about the wall replied the woodman when we have climbed over it we shall know
what is on the other side after a time the ladder was finished it looked clumsy but the tin woodman was sure it was strong and would answer their purpose the
scarecrow waked dorothy and the lion and toto and told them that the ladder was ready the scarecrow climbed up the ladder first but he was so awkward that dorothy
had to follow close behind and keep him from falling off when he got his head over the top of the wall the scarecrow said oh my go on exclaimed dorothy so the scarecrow
climbed farther up and sat down on the top of the wall and dorothy put her head over and cried oh my just as the scarecrow had done then toto came up and immediately
began to bark but dorothy made him be still the lion climbed the ladder next and the tin woodman came last but both of them cried oh my as soon as they looked over the
wall when they were all sitting in a row on the top of the wall they looked down and saw a strange sight before them was a great stretch of country having a floor as
smooth and shining and white as the bottom of a big platter scattered around were many houses made entirely of china and painted in the brightest colors these
houses were quite small the biggest of them reaching only as high as dorothys waist there were also pretty little barns with china fences around them and many cows
and sheep and horses and pigs and chickens all made of china were standing about in groups but the strangest of all were the people who lived in this queer country
there were milkmaids and shepherdesses with brightly colored bodices and golden spots all over their gowns and princesses with most gorgeous frocks of silver
and gold and purple and shepherds dressed in knee breeches with pink and yellow and blue stripes down them and golden buckles on their shoes and princes with
jeweled crowns upon their heads wearing ermine robes and satin doublets and funny clowns in ruffled gowns with round red spots upon their cheeks and tall pointed
caps and strangest of all these people were all made of china even to their clothes and were so small that the tallest of them was no higher than dorothys knee no one
did so much as look at the travelers at first except one little purple china dog with an extra large head which came to the wall and barked at them in a tiny voice
afterwards running away again how shall we get down asked dorothy they found the ladder so heavy they could not pull it up so the scarecrow fell off the wall and the
others jumped down upon him so that the hard floor would not hurt their feet of course they took pains not to light on his head and get the pins in their feet when all
were safely down they picked up the scarecrow whose body was quite flattened out and patted his straw into shape again we must cross this strange place in order to
get to the other side said dorothy for it would be unwise for us to go any other way except due south they began walking through the country of the china people and the
first thing they came to was a china milkmaid milking a china cow as they drew near the cow suddenly gave a kick and kicked over the stool the pail and even the
milkmaid herself and all fell on the china ground with a great clatter dorothy was shocked to see that the cow had broken her leg off and that the pail was lying in
several small pieces while the poor milkmaid had a nick in her left elbow there cried the milkmaid angrily see what you have done my cow has broken her leg and i must
take her to the menders shop and have it glued on again what do you mean by coming here and frightening my cow im very sorry returned dorothy please forgive us but the
pretty milkmaid was much too vexed to make any answer she picked up the leg sulkily and led her cow away the poor animal limping on three legs as she left them the
milkmaid cast many reproachful glances over her shoulder at the clumsy strangers holding her nicked elbow close to her side dorothy was quite grieved at this
mishap we must be very careful here said the kind hearted woodman or we may hurt these pretty little people so they will never get over it a little farther on dorothy
met a most beautifully dressed young princess who stopped short as she saw the strangers and started to run away dorothy wanted to see more of the princess so she
ran after her but the china girl cried out dont chase me dont chase me she had such a frightened little voice that dorothy stopped and said why not because answered
the princess also stopping a safe distance away if i run i may fall down and break myself but could you not be mended asked the girl oh yes but one is never so pretty
after being mended you know replied the princess i suppose not said dorothy now there is mr joker one of our clowns continued the china lady who is always trying to
stand upon his head he has broken himself so often that he is mended in a hundred places and doesnt look at all pretty here he comes now so you can see for yourself
indeed a jolly little clown came walking toward them and dorothy could see that in spite of his pretty clothes of red and yellow and green he was completely covered
with cracks running every which way and showing plainly that he had been mended in many places the clown put his hands in his pockets and after puffing out his
cheeks and nodding his head at them saucily he said my lady fair why do you stare at poor old mr joker youre quite as stiff and prim as if youd eaten up a poker be quiet
sir said the princess cant you see these are strangers and should be treated with respect well thats respect i expect declared the clown and immediately stood
upon his head dont mind mr joker said the princess to dorothy he is considerably cracked in his head and that makes him foolish oh i dont mind him a bit said dorothy
but you are so beautiful she continued that i am sure i could love you dearly wont you let me carry you back to kansas and stand you on aunt ems mantel i could carry you
in my basket that would make me very unhappy answered the china princess you see here in our country we live contentedly and can talk and move around as we please but
whenever any of us are taken away our joints at once stiffen and we can only stand straight and look pretty of course that is all that is expected of us when we are on
mantels and cabinets and drawing room tables but our lives are much pleasanter here in our own country i would not make you unhappy for all the world exclaimed
dorothy so ill just say good bye good bye replied the princess they walked carefully through the china country the little animals and all the people scampered out
of their way fearing the strangers would break them and after an hour or so the travelers reached the other side of the country and came to another china wall it was
not so high as the first however and by standing upon the lions back they all managed to scramble to the top then the lion gathered his legs under him and jumped on the
wall but just as he jumped he upset a china church with his tail and smashed it all to pieces that was too bad said dorothy but really i think we were lucky in not doing
these little people more harm than breaking a cows leg and a church they are all so brittle they are indeed said the scarecrow and i am thankful i am made of straw and
cannot be easily damaged there are worse things in the world than being a scarecrow after climbing down from the china wall the travelers found themselves in a
disagreeable country full of bogs and marshes and covered with tall rank grass it was difficult to walk without falling into muddy holes for the grass was so thick
that it hid them from sight however by carefully picking their way they got safely along until they reached solid ground but here the country seemed wilder than
ever and after a long and tiresome walk through the underbrush they entered another forest where the trees were bigger and older than any they had ever seen this
forest is perfectly delightful declared the lion looking around him with joy never have i seen a more beautiful place it seems gloomy said the scarecrow not a bit
of it answered the lion i should like to live here all my life see how soft the dried leaves are under your feet and how rich and green the moss is that clings to these
old trees surely no wild beast could wish a pleasanter home perhaps there are wild beasts in the forest now said dorothy i suppose there are returned the lion but i
do not see any of them about they walked through the forest until it became too dark to go any farther dorothy and toto and the lion lay down to sleep while the woodman
and the scarecrow kept watch over them as usual when morning came they started again before they had gone far they heard a low rumble as of the growling of many wild
animals toto whimpered a little but none of the others was frightened and they kept along the well trodden path until they came to an opening in the wood in which
were gathered hundreds of beasts of every variety there were tigers and elephants and bears and wolves and foxes and all the others in the natural history and for a
moment dorothy was afraid but the lion explained that the animals were holding a meeting and he judged by their snarling and growling that they were in great
trouble as he spoke several of the beasts caught sight of him and at once the great assemblage hushed as if by magic the biggest of the tigers came up to the lion and
bowed saying welcome o king of beasts you have come in good time to fight our enemy and bring peace to all the animals of the forest once more what is your trouble
asked the lion quietly we are all threatened answered the tiger by a fierce enemy which has lately come into this forest it is a most tremendous monster like a great
spider with a body as big as an elephant and legs as long as a tree trunk it has eight of these long legs and as the monster crawls through the forest he seizes an animal
with a leg and drags it to his mouth where he eats it as a spider does a fly not one of us is safe while this fierce creature is alive and we had called a meeting to decide
how to take care of ourselves when you came among us the lion thought for a moment are there any other lions in this forest he asked no there were some but the monster
has eaten them all and besides they were none of them nearly so large and brave as you if i put an end to your enemy will you bow down to me and obey me as king of the forest
inquired the lion we will do that gladly returned the tiger and all the other beasts roared with a mighty roar we will where is this great spider of yours now asked
the lion yonder among the oak trees said the tiger pointing with his forefoot take good care of these friends of mine said the lion and i will go at once to fight the
monster he bade his comrades good bye and marched proudly away to do battle with the enemy the great spider was lying asleep when the lion found him and it looked so
ugly that its foe turned up his nose in disgust its legs were quite as long as the tiger had said and its body covered with coarse black hair it had a great mouth with a
row of sharp teeth a foot long but its head was joined to the pudgy body by a neck as slender as a wasps waist this gave the lion a hint of the best way to attack the
creature and as he knew it was easier to fight it asleep than awake he gave a great spring and landed directly upon the monsters back then with one blow of his heavy
paw all armed with sharp claws he knocked the spiders head from its body jumping down he watched it until the long legs stopped wiggling when he knew it was quite
dead the lion went back to the opening where the beasts of the forest were waiting for him and said proudly you need fear your enemy no longer then the beasts bowed
down to the lion as their king and he promised to come back and rule over them as soon as dorothy was safely on her way to kansas the four travelers passed through the
rest of the forest in safety and when they came out from its gloom saw before them a steep hill covered from top to bottom with great pieces of rock that will be a hard
climb said the scarecrow but we must get over the hill nevertheless so he led the way and the others followed they had nearly reached the first rock when they heard a
rough voice cry out keep back who are you asked the scarecrow then a head showed itself over the rock and the same voice said this hill belongs to us and we dont allow
anyone to cross it but we must cross it said the scarecrow were going to the country of the quadlings but you shall not replied the voice and there stepped from
behind the rock the strangest man the travelers had ever seen he was quite short and stout and had a big head which was flat at the top and supported by a thick neck
full of wrinkles but he had no arms at all and seeing this the scarecrow did not fear that so helpless a creature could prevent them from climbing the hill so he said
im sorry not to do as you wish but we must pass over your hill whether you like it or not and he walked boldly forward as quick as lightning the mans head shot forward
and his neck stretched out until the top of the head where it was flat struck the scarecrow in the middle and sent him tumbling over and over down the hill almost as
quickly as it came the head went back to the body and the man laughed harshly as he said it isnt as easy as you think a chorus of boisterous laughter came from the other
rocks and dorothy saw hundreds of the armless hammer heads upon the hillside one behind every rock the lion became quite angry at the laughter caused by the
scarecrows mishap and giving a loud roar that echoed like thunder he dashed up the hill again a head shot swiftly out and the great lion went rolling down the hill as
if he had been struck by a cannon ball dorothy ran down and helped the scarecrow to his feet and the lion came up to her feeling rather bruised and sore and said it is
useless to fight people with shooting heads no one can withstand them what can we do then she asked call the winged monkeys suggested the tin woodman you have still
the right to command them once more very well she answered and putting on the golden cap she uttered the magic words the monkeys were as prompt as ever and in a few
moments the entire band stood before her what are your commands inquired the king of the monkeys bowing low carry us over the hill to the country of the quadlings
answered the girl it shall be done said the king and at once the winged monkeys caught the four travelers and toto up in their arms and flew away with them as they
passed over the hill the hammer heads yelled with vexation and shot their heads high in the air but they could not reach the winged monkeys which carried dorothy
and her comrades safely over the hill and set them down in the beautiful country of the quadlings this is the last time you can summon us said the leader to dorothy so
good bye and good luck to you good bye and thank you very much returned the girl and the monkeys rose into the air and were out of sight in a twinkling the country of the
quadlings seemed rich and happy there was field upon field of ripening grain with well paved roads running between and pretty rippling brooks with strong
bridges across them the fences and houses and bridges were all painted bright red just as they had been painted yellow in the country of the winkies and blue in the
country of the munchkins the quadlings themselves who were short and fat and looked chubby and good natured were dressed all in red which showed bright against
the green grass and the yellowing grain the monkeys had set them down near a farmhouse and the four travelers walked up to it and knocked at the door it was opened by
the farmers wife and when dorothy asked for something to eat the woman gave them all a good dinner with three kinds of cake and four kinds of cookies and a bowl of milk
for toto how far is it to the castle of glinda asked the child it is not a great way answered the farmers wife take the road to the south and you will soon reach it
thanking the good woman they started afresh and walked by the fields and across the pretty bridges until they saw before them a very beautiful castle before the
gates were three young girls dressed in handsome red uniforms trimmed with gold braid and as dorothy approached one of them said to her why have you come to the
south country to see the good witch who rules here she answered will you take me to her let me have your name and i will ask glinda if she will receive you they told who
they were and the girl soldier went into the castle after a few moments she came back to say that dorothy and the others were to be admitted at once before they went to
see glinda however they were taken to a room of the castle where dorothy washed her face and combed her hair and the lion shook the dust out of his mane and the
scarecrow patted himself into his best shape and the woodman polished his tin and oiled his joints when they were all quite presentable they followed the soldier
girl into a big room where the witch glinda sat upon a throne of rubies she was both beautiful and young to their eyes her hair was a rich red in color and fell in
flowing ringlets over her shoulders her dress was pure white but her eyes were blue and they looked kindly upon the little girl what can i do for you my child she
asked dorothy told the witch all her story how the cyclone had brought her to the land of oz how she had found her companions and of the wonderful adventures they had
met with my greatest wish now she added is to get back to kansas for aunt em will surely think something dreadful has happened to me and that will make her put on
mourning and unless the crops are better this year than they were last i am sure uncle henry cannot afford it glinda leaned forward and kissed the sweet upturned
face of the loving little girl bless your dear heart she said i am sure i can tell you of a way to get back to kansas then she added but if i do you must give me the golden
cap willingly exclaimed dorothy indeed it is of no use to me now and when you have it you can command the winged monkeys three times and i think i shall need their
service just those three times answered glinda smiling dorothy then gave her the golden cap and the witch said to the scarecrow what will you do when dorothy has
left us i will return to the emerald city he replied for oz has made me its ruler and the people like me the only thing that worries me is how to cross the hill of the
hammer heads by means of the golden cap i shall command the winged monkeys to carry you to the gates of the emerald city said glinda for it would be a shame to deprive
the people of so wonderful a ruler am i really wonderful asked the scarecrow you are unusual replied glinda turning to the tin woodman she asked what will become of
you when dorothy leaves this country he leaned on his axe and thought a moment then he said the winkies were very kind to me and wanted me to rule over them after the
wicked witch died i am fond of the winkies and if i could get back again to the country of the west i should like nothing better than to rule over them forever my second
command to the winged monkeys said glinda will be that they carry you safely to the land of the winkies your brain may not be so large to look at as those of the
scarecrow but you are really brighter than he is when you are well polished and i am sure you will rule the winkies wisely and well then the witch looked at the big
shaggy lion and asked when dorothy has returned to her own home what will become of you over the hill of the hammer heads he answered lies a grand old forest and all
the beasts that live there have made me their king if i could only get back to this forest i would pass my life very happily there my third command to the winged
monkeys said glinda shall be to carry you to your forest then having used up the powers of the golden cap i shall give it to the king of the monkeys that he and his band
may thereafter be free for evermore the scarecrow and the tin woodman and the lion now thanked the good witch earnestly for her kindness and dorothy exclaimed you
are certainly as good as you are beautiful but you have not yet told me how to get back to kansas your silver shoes will carry you over the desert replied glinda if you
had known their power you could have gone back to your aunt em the very first day you came to this country but then i should not have had my wonderful brains cried the
scarecrow i might have passed my whole life in the farmers cornfield and i should not have had my lovely heart said the tin woodman i might have stood and rusted in
the forest till the end of the world and i should have lived a coward forever declared the lion and no beast in all the forest would have had a good word to say to me this
is all true said dorothy and i am glad i was of use to these good friends but now that each of them has had what he most desired and each is happy in having a kingdom to
rule besides i think i should like to go back to kansas the silver shoes said the good witch have wonderful powers and one of the most curious things about them is
that they can carry you to any place in the world in three steps and each step will be made in the wink of an eye all you have to do is to knock the heels together three
times and command the shoes to carry you wherever you wish to go if that is so said the child joyfully i will ask them to carry me back to kansas at once she threw her
arms around the lions neck and kissed him patting his big head tenderly then she kissed the tin woodman who was weeping in a way most dangerous to his joints but she
hugged the soft stuffed body of the scarecrow in her arms instead of kissing his painted face and found she was crying herself at this sorrowful parting from her
loving comrades glinda the good stepped down from her ruby throne to give the little girl a good bye kiss and dorothy thanked her for all the kindness she had shown
to her friends and herself dorothy now took toto up solemnly in her arms and having said one last good bye she clapped the heels of her shoes together three times
saying take me home to aunt em instantly she was whirling through the air so swiftly that all she could see or feel was the wind whistling past her ears the silver
shoes took but three steps and then she stopped so suddenly that she rolled over upon the grass several times before she knew where she was at length however she sat
up and looked about her good gracious she cried for she was sitting on the broad kansas prairie and just before her was the new farmhouse uncle henry built after the
cyclone had carried away the old one uncle henry was milking the cows in the barnyard and toto had jumped out of her arms and was running toward the barn barking
furiously dorothy stood up and found she was in her stocking feet for the silver shoes had fallen off in her flight through the air and were lost forever in the
desert aunt em had just come out of the house to water the cabbages when she looked up and saw dorothy running toward her my darling child she cried folding the
little girl in her arms and covering her face with kisses where in the world did you come from from the land of oz said dorothy gravely and here is toto too and oh aunt
em im so glad to be at home again alice was beginning
